      "\n",
      "• **Prioritize Housekeeping & Maintenance Standards** – Cleanliness and room condition are consistently praised but operational failures (faulty thermostats, broken amenities, poor housekeeping, low water pressure) significantly damage guest satisfaction. Implement rigorous quality control protocols and preventive maintenance schedules.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Strengthen Staff Training & Consistency** – Exceptional staff service is the strongest positive driver across reviews, yet inconsistencies exist (dismissive behavior, impolite cleaning staff, poor manager responses). Invest in comprehensive training programs and accountability measures to ensure consistent excellence across all departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Address Parking & Hidden Fees Friction** – Unexpected parking charges and undisclosed fees create disproportionate negative sentiment despite otherwise positive stays. Clearly communicate all costs upfront and consider competitive pricing to reduce checkout frustrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Leverage Location & Amenities as Core Strengths** – Location, cleanliness, and staff friendliness are the most frequently praised attributes. Continue investing in these differentiators while using them to offset minor room limitations or standard amenities.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Resolve Room Comfort Issues** – Recurring complaints about bed comfort, room size, AC noise, and amenity gaps (WiFi, coffee reliability) suggest standardization gaps. Audit room inventory, upgrade furnishings, and ensure consistent amenity delivery across all room types.\n"
