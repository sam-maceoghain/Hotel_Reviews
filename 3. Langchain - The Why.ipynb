       "3  the hotel itself was very nice. the desk staff were very attentive and helpful. the rooms were nice but not dusted/cleaned adequately each day. the problems we had were few but definitely impacted whether we would stay there again. the hallways and elevators were not air-conditioned and were in the high 80's in july. also, with no complimentary breakfast offered, the free coffee was in high demand. the coffee hours ended at 9:00 a.m. and the coffee was always empty, missing \"to go\" cups, or out of cream and sugar. a daily conversation with the desk staff on this issue grew tiresome with our 7 day stay. look elsewhere if service is important to you.   \n",
