       "14  we chose this hotel because kimpton's have a great reputation and they are pet friendly. upon arrival (around 9pm) we were disappointed that there was no door staff/valet etc so we ended up taking in the luggage ourselves. when the bellman did see me they didn't offer to help. check-in was quick and front desk girl was very friendly, greeted dori by name and offered her a pet package. the room was large and comfortable but there were some areas where you can see the hotel is showing some wear and tear. overall still very good. all the amenities of a kimpton including 4pm kids hour, 5pm wine hour and most importantly for us pet friendly. the hotel was very busy as it was memorial day weekend so the restaurant and room service had delays but that's to be expected. i would choose this hotel again especially for the proximity of being in the middle of old town, several blocks from the water front and in the midst of amazing restaurants like restaurant eve.   \n",
