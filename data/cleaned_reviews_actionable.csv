the hotel was great. staff went above and beyond bringing hot tea to room at 11:30 pm at no charge!,POSITIVE,Staff provided exceptional service by delivering complimentary hot tea late night.
"a wonderful hotel - would definitely stay there whenever we are in alexandria again.  wonderful staff.  we remarked that the first room was very far from the elevator, and they immediately moved us to a much nicer/larger room across from the elevator without question.  i hope i am able to stay at a kimpton hotel on future trips.",POSITIVE,"Excellent staff service, room upgrade, and overall wonderful experience."
"i needed a place to stay in va that was close to or in alexandria and the monaco was available for a great value. i enjoyed my stay, room was comfortable and clean. was disappointed on parking cost but i was able to work around that. very convenient to old town.",POSITIVE,"Guest appreciated value, comfort, cleanliness, and location despite parking concerns."
"the hotel itself was very nice. the desk staff were very attentive and helpful. the rooms were nice but not dusted/cleaned adequately each day. the problems we had were few but definitely impacted whether we would stay there again. the hallways and elevators were not air-conditioned and were in the high 80's in july. also, with no complimentary breakfast offered, the free coffee was in high demand. the coffee hours ended at 9:00 a.m. and the coffee was always empty, missing ""to go"" cups, or out of cream and sugar. a daily conversation with the desk staff on this issue grew tiresome with our 7 day stay. look elsewhere if service is important to you.",NEGATIVE,"Multiple service failures including poor housekeeping, inadequate climate control, and unreliable complimentary coffee."
"we arrive around 1 am,  for a 5 night stay, and the lady could not find our reservation. after a while she she found it but could not tell us a thing about our expedia gold benefits. she told us it was not her problem a we should ask the manager eventually.",NEGATIVE,Staff unable to locate reservation and dismissive about guest benefits.
"excellent location, good value, clean and comfortable room. what more could you ask for?!",POSITIVE,"Guest praised location, value, cleanliness, and comfort with enthusiastic tone."
"overall the stay was fine. room was clean, bed & pillow were comfortable, nice toiletries and towels. check in was a little slow, but staff in the lobby were nice. however, the ac unit is loud & in the room. the mini fridge is somewhat noisy. and the toilet kept running every 10 minutes (loudest filling toilet ever). and the headboard had seen some damage (fake leather). the location is great though. short walk to harbor area, lots of restaurants, etc.",NEUTRAL,Positive amenities and location offset by multiple noise and maintenance issues.
"the room was very nice and clean. the hotel was uniquely decorated and stylish. the location was nice if you plan to go out in old town, but a good 20+ minute walk to public transportation and a hike to get into dc.",POSITIVE,"Clean, stylish rooms and decor outweigh accessibility concerns."
"the hotel exceeded our expectations. our room and the hotel was well kept, clean and the decor tasteful.the 5 p.m. manager hosted wine tasting is an excellent way to return to the hotel after a nice day out to see the sites and touring. it was also a great ice breaker to meet other guests (or not).to top it off this particular property is perfectly located on king street in historic alexandria surrounded by shops and excellent choices of restaurants.we will definitely stay here again and will recommend to friends.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised cleanliness, decor, amenities, location, and expressed intent to return."
"from check in to check out the staff goes out of its way to insure that your stay is problem free. beautiful rooms, excellent staff, great location. we go to alexandria 2-3 times a year to enjoy the history and would not think of staying elsewhere. it is located right in the heart of old alexandria and within walking distance of everything.",POSITIVE,"Staff excellence, beautiful rooms, and prime location create exceptional guest experiences."
lovely. stayed there for the inauguration and the staff was on top of their game. very attentive despite a packed house and also lots of sweet touches like shuttles to the metro on inauguration day etc.went on to stay at the monaco in chicago and was so disappointed by the service after a wonderful stay at the monaco in alexandria.,POSITIVE,Staff was attentive and thoughtful with special touches during busy inauguration event.
"the hotel is right in the heart of old town alexandria on king street. shops, bakeries and wonderful restaurants lined the street. the 1 mile walk to the metro gave us plenty of opportunities to window shop. the staff was great. our room was a little on the small side, but for 2 nights we were more than satisfied. highly recommended.",POSITIVE,"Excellent location, great staff, and overall satisfaction despite minor room size issue."
"my daughter and i had our first get-away alone since she started her family. we live in baltimore so the journey was short.  i love this hotel and its lovely staff, great wine reception, dog-friendliness.  we enjoyed the large pool and sat in front of the reception fire place to warm up and meet interesting guests.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised staff, amenities, and memorable bonding experience with daughter."
"great hotel, great location, excellent room...thermometor in room did not register correct temperature, too hot to sleep, the hallway was colder than our room.we had it set on the lowest setting it would go.also, the key card would not work the first time, and as petty as it sounds, i had to walk all the way back downstairs, wait in line and then hope the key would work when i went back upstairs.in this day and age, all hotels should have free internet, at least in the lobby.looked clean, but i dropped an ear ring back close to the edge of the bed, when i picked it up, there were ""things"" clinging to it, needed better vacuuming?",NEGATIVE,"Multiple operational failures: faulty thermostat, malfunctioning key card, poor cleanliness, missing WiFi."
"we chose this hotel because kimpton's have a great reputation and they are pet friendly. upon arrival (around 9pm) we were disappointed that there was no door staff/valet etc so we ended up taking in the luggage ourselves. when the bellman did see me they didn't offer to help. check-in was quick and front desk girl was very friendly, greeted dori by name and offered her a pet package. the room was large and comfortable but there were some areas where you can see the hotel is showing some wear and tear. overall still very good. all the amenities of a kimpton including 4pm kids hour, 5pm wine hour and most importantly for us pet friendly. the hotel was very busy as it was memorial day weekend so the restaurant and room service had delays but that's to be expected. i would choose this hotel again especially for the proximity of being in the middle of old town, several blocks from the water front and in the midst of amazing restaurants like restaurant eve.",POSITIVE,"Guest appreciated pet-friendly amenities, location, and friendly staff despite minor service gaps."
"very friendly staff; good location. child and pet friendly. great swimming pool. nice, interesting decor; clean. overall, a very good hotel.",POSITIVE,"Excellent staff, amenities, cleanliness, and family-friendly features throughout."
"the room was clean and very nice. the bed and pillows were perfect. the only issue was checkout...they overcharged me for parking. it wasn't listed on final receipt and i would've never known if i didn't check my credit card statement (this wasn't the credit card holding charge). quickly resolved, but still a hassle and the reason for less than 5 stars",POSITIVE,Excellent room quality overshadowed by unexpected parking overcharge at checkout.
excellent location and friendly staff. we loved the free wine and snacks from 5-6 nightly,POSITIVE,"Guest praised location, staff friendliness, and complimentary evening wine and snacks."
my only real complaint is why pay for parking & 2 use the internet on your own cell? shouldn't that be on the hotel? just a thought,NEGATIVE,Guest objects to paid parking and internet charges that should be complimentary.
great value for the money. convenient location in old town close to many fun things.,POSITIVE,Guest praised value for money and convenient Old Town location near attractions.
"we arrived late and the hotel staff couldn't have been nicer or more efficient.  we were settled in our room in less than 10 minutes.  when i couldn't connect to wifi, a call to the front desk resulted in a knock on our door within two minutes.  i had some special needs, and the staff did an excellent job of meeting them.  the hotel is perfect for a stay in alexandria.",POSITIVE,"Staff efficiency, responsiveness, and exceptional service meeting special needs impressed the guest."
"had an amazing stay. clean hotel, very friendly staff!!!",POSITIVE,"Guest praised cleanliness, staff friendliness, and overall amazing experience."
"i was expecting a typical kimpton stay - wine and hors d'oeurves at 5 pm in the ""living room"", but found out when we got there they didn't do that because of some abc laws in alexandria - though the embassy suites does offer it. room service breakfast was quite expensive... on the flip side - the location cannot be beat - right on the free trolley route and close to all old town alexandria awesomeness!!!",NEUTRAL,Guest experienced both disappointment with amenities and delight with location.
a wonderful 2 night stay in hotel monaco alexandria. room was decorated beautifully. bathroom was luxurious with all the amenties. bed was wonderful and comfortable. hotel was right in the heart of old town with no reason to move/use the car. staff was always great. i particularly liked that the staff at the door always welcomed me back or wished me a nice day. and that staff in other locations always made eye contact/smiled/had a positive comment.only tiny negative was finding a previous patron's leftovers in the mini fridge.,POSITIVE,"Exceptional service, beautiful décor, and comfort outweighed minor cleanliness issue."
"i booked through this third-party site, paid extra for a room with a balcony & made a notation in the ""notes"" section that we'd like a roll-away bed for a child if it was available (the website said they were available on a first-come basis). when i arrived, without warning, the bellhop led us to a standard double room (the cheapest type, with no balcony). i explained to him that we'd reserved a room w/ a balcony, he called the front desk and they told him none was available. he handed the phone to me & i asked the girl on the other end if i could speak to a manager. he was rude, did not apologize for the situation, & flatly told me that because i had booked through a certain third-party reservation site, there was nothing he could do about the error. he eventually clarified that since i had booked a room with one bed (albeit a king), but had asked for a second bed, they simply changed the reservation to a double room. he said there was no way to notify me of this, because the third-party reservation company does not supply the names or phone numbers of people who make reservations. he had no explanation for how the hotel front-desk staff had been able to match my name & id to a reservation. anyway, he refused to refund the difference in the price of the room. he offered to put us in a room with a balcony the next day. he told me to start calling them the next day at about noon to see if one would be available. one eventually did come available the next day at 5 p.m. & we took it. it was too dark to even see the balcony (half the point of a balcony room was to have the extra sunlight). i complained about it long enough that an hour later, someone showed up with a free bottle of wine & an apology letter for the ""miscommunication"", but there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the rooms, & the bad customer service made the trip a little worse than it needed to be.our first room on the 6th (top) floor had too little water pressure to take a good shower. other than that, the hotel itself was perfectly nice. hopefully the manager moves on. i may try it again next time i'm in the area, but i would not recommend booking this hotel through a discount hotel website.",NEGATIVE,"Room downgrade, poor manager service, no refund, and low water pressure ruined stay."
nice hotel in a beautiful area of washington. room needs a bit of a refurbishment (e.g. heating unit made an terribly loud noise as it shut on and off during the night) and the gym needs upgrading.,NEUTRAL,Guest praised location and hotel quality but noted maintenance issues.
thoroughly enjoyed our stay. loved early evening wine in the lobby and it was great fun that the hotel is dog friendly even though we didn't have a dog with us.,POSITIVE,"Guest praised wine service, dog-friendly policy, and overall enjoyable stay experience."
the hotel was in a great location. the rooms were beautiful and very clean. the customer service was outstanding!!! it was nice to be greeted by name without them having to look at my credit card first!,POSITIVE,"Guest praised location, cleanliness, room quality, and personalized customer service."
"we had a great night at the monaco.  i have stayed at both this one and the one in downtown dc.  love them both.  great people, management, and hotel.  we will be back.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised staff, management, and hotel quality with intent to return."
we had a wonderful stay. rooms are large and very clean. all of the staff were super friendly and extremely helpful in all regards.,POSITIVE,"Large clean rooms and exceptionally friendly, helpful staff created a wonderful experience."
this hotel is well located in a very attractice and historical site. rooms are kind of small but comfortable. service is excellent and staff very friendly.the restaurant has an excellent menu and seems to be popular among locals.,POSITIVE,"Excellent service, friendly staff, great restaurant, and attractive location outweigh minor room size concerns."
"the stay was good, price of the room was too expensive for the hotel. i have stayed in others in the area for less than half the price, that had more services and free parking. don't think i will recommend or stay there again.",NEGATIVE,Room price excessive compared to competitors offering more services and free parking.
"this hotel used to be a holiday inn -- the hotel is limited by that configuration.  monaco has tried to make it a boutique hotel and have done a pretty good job, but it is not a four star hotel.  i would give it three stars.  other than that, they try hard, did a good job, and we were quite satisfied with staff, location, and cleanliness.",POSITIVE,"Guest satisfied with staff, location, and cleanliness despite structural limitations."
"the staff were attentive, but the cleaning staff were a touch impolite at times.the restaurant served decent breakfast. parking was quite expensive, at $27 a day.",NEUTRAL,Mixed experiences: attentive staff offset by impolite cleaning staff and expensive parking.
"king st is amazing. my wife called it a clean bourbon street. i agree. it is not as raucous (good thing) and there are tons of restaurants and shops within walking distance. also, the whole old towne alexandria is very inviting.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised location's cleanliness, walkable restaurants/shops, and inviting atmosphere."
we only stayed one night but it was wonderful. staff was very friendly and accommodating. room was clean beautiful comfortable we felt as though we were at home. location is very nice nice to walk around with the shops close to the water. we would stay here again in a heartbeat.,POSITIVE,"Guest praised friendly staff, clean comfortable room, and excellent location."
"beautiful hotel - cozy room, nicely appointed and clean. love the wine happy hour! great location and friendly staff. will definitely stay there again.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised multiple aspects: room quality, amenities, location, and staff friendliness."
"when we go back to dc we usually stay at the monaco because of its location.  if my husband has to take the car for a meeting, i can walk to the shops and restaurants and i feel completely comfortable there.  when we are together, it's convenient to everything we need to get to, our old neighborhood, good restaurants and the major highways.this past weekend, there were a lot of little kids and dogs, i guess because it was a holiday weekend.  we heard dogs barking and kids crying, didn't bother us too much since it was during the day, if it disturbed our sleep this review might have had a different ending.",POSITIVE,"Excellent location enables convenient access to shops, restaurants, and highways."
"this hotel is located in old town, alexandria, va. it is a renovated older hotel but the rooms were quite nice with marble sink and tile in the bath and nicely done d��cor. the hotel offers free shuttle service from reagan international, but it only runs every hour. however, if you call the hotel they will let you know where and when to meet the shuttle. they offer complementary coffee and tea each morning and a wine bar each evening although we did not use the latter. there are many restaurants near the hotel including a very nice french caf�� next door. if you are a kimpton rewards member, you can even receive a coupon good for $10 worth of items from the mini-bar in your room. the only negative was that the hotel is about a mile from the king st. metro stop which provides the quickest and least expensive access to washington, d.c.all things considered we would definitely consider staying there again during future visits.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised renovated rooms, amenities, location, and expressed intent to return."
"the staff was friendly and helpful and the room was very comfortable, clean and quiet. the location was convenient to basically everything (food, shopping, entertainment, transportation) in alexandria.",POSITIVE,"Staff friendliness, comfortable clean room, and convenient location drove positive sentiment."
"the hotel was a great location, walking distance to so much.  staff was very helpful.",POSITIVE,Great location and helpful staff created a positive guest experience.
have stayed at this hotel many times and the staff is personable & committed to excellence. kimpton's ability to identify quality individuals from diverse backgrounds and then have a top notch traing program is reflected in each stay.,POSITIVE,"Staff excellence, personable service, and strong training program consistently deliver quality experiences."
"this hotel has a nice charm; not your cookie cutter luxury hotel. the staff was nice, the location in old town is perfect.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised unique charm, friendly staff, and excellent Old Town location."
"all shopping and restaurants are short walks from the hotel.  the best location of any hotel in alexandria.  the staff was most accommodating.  one day, my wife and i decided to go for a walk along king street.  a member of the hotel staff ran to us with an umbrella in hand.  he suggested we talk it in the event of rain.  we look forward to a return visit to the hotel monaco in the near future.",POSITIVE,"Exceptional location, outstanding staff service, and memorable personal attention."
we had a fantastic time and highly recommend this hotel for families. the pool was fab and so was the happy hour for kids and adults.,POSITIVE,"Guests praised the pool and happy hour, recommending the hotel for families."
did recon for our wedding next year. will definitely have our guests stay here.,POSITIVE,"Guest plans to book hotel for wedding guests, indicating strong satisfaction."
"this hotel is located ideally right in the heart of old town alexandria, va.  it made it the perfect place to stay and see the sights.  we loved the quaint surroundings and the hotel staff and check-in process couldn't be more pleasant and efficient.  we would whole-heartedly recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting alexandria or the wash. dc area.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised ideal location, pleasant staff, efficient service, and quaint surroundings."
"a complimentary bottle of water and maybe a small coffee maker in the room would be nice.overall, i was very pleased.",POSITIVE,Guest expressed overall satisfaction despite suggesting minor room amenities improvements.
"after reading about the hotel monaco online, i changed my reservation at the marriott, and i was very glad that i did. you would expect to pay a lot more for this hotel that what our room rate was. the kimpton hotels are so cool - loved the room decorations, efficient bathroom, comfy beds and lively lobby. being a pet friendly hotel, it didn't smell. the outside furniture in the courtyard area was so relaxing at night. the menu for dinner was a bit different than what we expected and i would not eat there again. i loved this hotel and would stay there again when i go to old town to visit my son and his fiance.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised room quality, amenities, and value despite minor dining disappointment."
"we couldn't have been happier with our stay. the staff was uniformly friendly and kind, the room was great (a bit more creatively decorated than your typical hotel), and you just can't beat the location. we were just a few blocks from just about everything we wanted to do. (oh... and they have an indoor pool that we got a *lot* of use out of.)i wasn't expecting anything other than another cookie-cutter hotel, and i was really surprised at how wrong i was.",POSITIVE,"Guest exceeded expectations with friendly staff, creative decor, great location, and amenities."
"this was a fun, chic hotel in the perfect location for a night out on the old town.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised the hotel's fun atmosphere, chic design, and excellent location."
"the monaco is very well situated, near the king street shops and the waterfront. that is its best asset. also, particularly good is the service. the staff are welcoming and always helpful. otherwise, the hotel is standard for a premium hotel. the closets are a little cramped, but the windows open and the room temperature is well controlled. i have a personal dislike of duvets, but the hotel furnished the proper blanket.",POSITIVE,Excellent service and prime location outweigh standard amenities and minor room issues.
great hotel in great location but expensive rooms and parking. could have stayed a few blocks west on king street for $100 less a night had i known that bus service on king street is free and frequent. the two beds in our room where very narrow for two and who wants to sleep in separate beds?,NEUTRAL,Positive location and quality offset by high prices and uncomfortable sleeping arrangements.
"if you drive a car, then you shuld feel comportable and meet nice front desk. most of all, my family colud have good sleep on the very nice bed and bedclothes. near from the hotel, very good restaurants are there. don't worry about your breakfast and dinner with walking.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised comfortable beds, friendly staff, and convenient nearby dining options."
"great place to stay, super price for the service. attitude of hotel staff made the stay the best we've had in a long time. looking foward to next visit to dc",POSITIVE,"Excellent value, outstanding staff attitude, and memorable experience exceeded expectations."
the staff is top notch. there is a big difference in the size of the rooms (same price) the rooms that face king street are much larger then the interior rooms. it's a shame that there isn't any outdoor patio furniture,NEUTRAL,Positive staff feedback balanced by room inconsistencies and missing amenities.
overall we were pleased with our stay. the only downfall was that we had asked to be notified once our room was ready we had arrived about an hour before check in. when we contacted hotel staff around 45 minutes after allowed check in time we were told our room had been ready. very frustrating on a cold rainy day when we just wanted to get settled.,POSITIVE,Guest satisfied overall despite frustration with delayed room readiness notification.
this was a perfect base camp for touring dc. the metro station was within walking distance and a trolley was also available for getting to and from the metro. on the way to the metro station are lots of unique shops and restaurants. the area was totally safe for walking. the hotel is very close to the waterfront and the torpedo factory art center and the street entertainment in that area. located on king street this is a beautiful area to come back to after the bustle of dc. i hope to return again next year and will definitely stay in this hotel. wish we had had more time. highly recommend this beautiful hotel.,POSITIVE,"Guest praised location, safety, amenities, and expressed intent to return."
"the hotel had great service. the bathroom was newly remodeled, so was absolutely beautiful. the best part was the location - conveniently located to great restaurants, bakeries, metro, and the river.",POSITIVE,"Great service, beautiful bathroom, and excellent location near restaurants and metro."
"i stayed here a month ago, liked it so much that we returned here on our most recent trip. i didn't mention the daily wine reception with interesting wines in my last review. it is a nice event at 5pm daily in the lobby. creatively decorated rooms with a good bed for a restful nights sleep, great location for old town alexandria.",POSITIVE,"Guest returned for repeat stay, praising amenities, comfort, and location."
"excellent service throughout the hotel including the front desk, room service, jackson 20, bell service. the sleeping rooms are enchanting and relatively large. close to great shopping and restaurants and nightlife.",POSITIVE,Excellent service across all departments and appealing room features drove positive sentiment.
"the room was very elegant and cozy. we enjoyed our room decor quite a lot ! parking was an unexpected difficulty, and frankly started our visit off in an unhappy way. we couldn't even pull up to the hotel in our car due to its position in the street. there is a tiny amount of space for cars to pull into the valet area in the front of the hotel. once that area is filled with 2-3 cars, there is no where to even pull your vehicle to check in and unload the car. you end up in some garage down the street. also, the front desk was not helpful when they kept repeating in half broken english, ""the valet will help you, the valet will take care of you""-- yeah, maybe if we could get our car anywhere near them!however, once we finally got to out room, it was lovely. the rest of the staff was very courteous. i didn't appreciate the attitude if the woman at the front desk, but i still enjoyed my stay.",NEUTRAL,Positive room experience offset by significant parking and front desk frustrations.
"my husband and i stayed here at a friends recommendation and loved every minute of it. the hotel is excellent and in a great location. plenty of places to eat and shop close by. the only negative i have to say is the free trolley is not a reliable form of transportation. we walked to the king street metro station (14 blocks away) more than we road the trolley, but the walk was beautiful and peaceful. everyone around was super friendly. we are already talking about going back soon!!",POSITIVE,"Guests loved the location, amenities, friendly staff, and expressed intent to return."
the room was so nice and comfortable.  just a fabulous hotel.  food was fantastic in the restaurant.  close to everything i wanted and a great price too.,POSITIVE,"Guest praised room comfort, food quality, location, and value for money."
"you can't beat the location. old town alexandria is charming, and the hotel is right in the middle of it. there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. the restaurant next to the hotel is a bit spendy, but pretty good. the room itself was a bit small, and i would have liked a lock on the bathroom door, but the beds and pillows were comfy, and the tv service adequate. going into downtown d.c. was ~50 minutes door-to-door (to white house) by metro. i feel the hotel should offer a shuttle to the metro. we had to taxi, since the king street trolley only runs from 11am - 7pm--walking to the metro, while doable at 20m, would have made for a tiring day touring d.c. the parking garage is old and space is tight, so a couple nights we had to pay to park elsewhere, but its workable. most staff were nice, but a few times the staff were slightly less than helpful: room service comes too late in the day, and kept harassing us even though our child was napping and we asked them to come back later. one day while it was pouring rain outside, we tried to borrow an extra umbrella from the doorman (we're a family of 4 with 2 young kids), and were rebuffed [??]. but, the kids hour and wine hour are great, and the hotel is fun. bottom line, the location is great, and the charm of the hotel and the surrounding area make some of the small inconveniences insignificant.",POSITIVE,Excellent location and charm outweigh minor operational and room size issues.
"i thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. it was just for one night, and there was nothing negative. the location, staff, room - everything was just fine. my friends and i enjoyed happy hour in the lobby and an excellent dinner in the hotel's restaurant.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised location, staff, room quality, and dining experiences throughout stay."
this hotel was just charming. the decor was modern and eclectic and somewhat whimsical. everything was spotlessly clean. the bed was comfortable and the linens luxurious. i would recommend this to anyone.,POSITIVE,"Guest praised charming decor, cleanliness, comfort, and luxury linens throughout."
"this is a very nice, comfortable hotel. the service is excellent and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. nice location in old town alexandria about a mile from the king st. metro station (shuttles to and from the hotel available by simply calling the concierge).we highly recommend this to anyone.",POSITIVE,"Excellent service, friendly staff, comfortable accommodations, and convenient location."
great stay. perfect location in the heart of old town. we upgraded to the small suite with balcony. totally worth it!,POSITIVE,"Guest praised location, room upgrade, and overall experience as excellent."
we really liked this hotel. it was relaxing and we enjoyed our stay.,POSITIVE,Guests explicitly stated they liked the hotel and enjoyed their relaxing stay.
"we couldn't have chosen a better hotel.  it's within walking distance of everything, the staff was very attentive and the rooms had a very nice charm to them. the only (small) issue we had is that ac unit was a bit loud - but since we are getting to the warmer days, it is expected that the unit needs to work hard to keep the room at a certain temperature. we thought it was really convenient that they provided little items that are easily forgotten: toothbrush/paste, phone charger, etc - upon request.",POSITIVE,"Excellent location, attentive staff, charming rooms, and thoughtful amenities outweigh minor AC noise."
"wasn't informed of $27 parking fee at time of booking, found out about that at check in. room seemed closed in and dark, needs updating. shower curtain was dirty, looked like someone blew their nose on it. stained throw pillow and towel. mattress was horribly uncomfortable, both myself and my wife spent a restless night. forget the gym, the weight set is too complicated for a good workout and of the 5 pieces of cardio equipment, 1 functioned properly. the overall area had little to offer, unless you are into art. homeless people were sleeping in doorways 30 feet from the doors of the hotel in the morning. would not recommend this hotel to anyone. wish we hadn't wasted our time and money on this hotel. when we informed the staff of the condition of our room, we were met with an oh. thanks for nothing.",NEGATIVE,"Multiple service failures: hidden fees, dirty room, broken amenities, uncomfortable bed, poor staff response."
"this hotel is perfectly situated in old town alexandria, va   it is in the heart of town next to many restaurants and historic places.  with a rollaway bed and two double beds, my sons and a friend were easily accommodated in one room.  always a pleasure to be at this site.  some very small updates in the room do need to be done.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised location, accommodations, and experience despite minor room updates needed."
everyone was very helpful. i had an excellent experience and stay.,POSITIVE,Staff helpfulness and overall excellent experience drove positive sentiment.
"as a business traveler, i absolutely love staying at this hotel. not only are the rooms comfortable and tastefully decorated, but the service is fantastic. the lobby is the ""place to be,"" with plenty of action, wine hour, and coffee/tea in the mornings. the location is perfect for me as well, with an unending supply of great restaurants and bars within walking distance. i also like the small touches in the room, like a hair dryer, extra space, and robes.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised comfortable rooms, fantastic service, vibrant lobby, and convenient location."
"we drove into town for the cherry blossoms festival in d.c., but didn't want to stay in $300+ hotels in the city...that's where monaco provided the much needed relaxing atmosphere for this one-night stay and all the amenities and comfort that one might need. awesome shower and comfy bed (two of my critical features), as well as location in the middle of alexandria's shopping & restaurant district made this stay very memorable. helpful staff at the front desk was a pleasant bonus, as well.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised relaxing atmosphere, amenities, location, and helpful staff."
very relaxing  and close to restaurants and the waterfront.  easy access to the water taxi to dc,POSITIVE,"Guest praised relaxing atmosphere, convenient location near restaurants, waterfront, and water taxi access."
we were pleasantly surprised by the decor and size of our room. we stayed in a double bed guestroom and had plenty of space. the bathroom was spacious and very clean. the pool area had plenty of windows that opened up and the fresh air was nice. i would highly recommend this hotel to couples and families.,POSITIVE,"Guest praised room decor, spacious accommodations, cleanliness, and amenities."
"staying in old town alexandria was great--the area has so much to offer in terms of restaurants, unique shopping, and historic character. i was there for a whole week, so had lots of opportunity to interact with staff when coming and going--especially since i had a car in valet parking. they were extremely friendly and personable, addressing me by name after the first day there. the atmosphere of the hotel was very inviting. the restaurant was also good--although the quantities were huge, so i found myself leaving food on the plate. the room would be better if it had an arm chair or someplace else to sit--there was an odd large ottoman, but it was not a good place to watch tv from or read. other than that, everything was very nice.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised staff friendliness, location amenities, and inviting atmosphere despite minor room concerns."
"from the time we walked into the hotel until we left with our bags after check out, the staff at this location was nothing less than fantastic! they made us feel important and addressed any concern we had with immediate attention. i was filling out a survey about the hotel, and left a less than satisfied mark on the questionnaire. within 5 minutes, i received a call from the front desk and an email. my problem? we were 20 mins away from where our plans were. even though it had nothing to do with them, this hotel was all about making our visit enjoyable. kudos to the front desk, cleaning staff, and everyone else that works at this place!",POSITIVE,Staff provided exceptional service and promptly addressed guest concerns with genuine care.
lovely boutique hotel that is located in heart of old alexandria.  good for children and adults with quick foods close by and coffee in lobby.  wonderfully located and personnel were delightful and helpful.,POSITIVE,"Excellent location, delightful staff, and family-friendly amenities impressed the guest."
"my wife and i stayed here for a weekend get away. the hotel is awesome! great staff, really cool vibe and great location. the hotel is pet friendly so we saw some pretty cool dogs and surprisingly we didn't hear any barking at night ( i was a little concerned about that). there's so much to see and do within walking distance. we valeted our car for $25 and walked everywhere. so overall it's a great place to stay. a few little critiques: 1. some of the fixtures in our room we loose or broken. 2. the fridge is locked and you have to ask for the key. kinda odd. it's stocked full of wine, beer and liquor, plus some snacks and even socks! but there's no room to put anything of your own in there ( i know, i know, it's wet bar, but one shelf would be great). we didn't buy anything, but everything is reasonably priced. - so the bottom line is, we will be back!",POSITIVE,"Guests praised staff, location, and amenities despite minor room maintenance issues."
"this is a prime example of how great the unpublished rates can be! plush, spacious room with luxury amenities such as marble bathrooms, a big deep bathtub, overstuffed chaise lounge chairs, dreamlike bedding, beautiful decor. rooms like these truly make leaving home and sleeping elsewhere a treat that one can look forward to.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised luxurious amenities, spacious rooms, and high-quality furnishings throughout."
"located on king st., shopping and all amenities available. comfortable and beautiful accommodations with a very friendly staff.  whenever i need to be in dc, i choose to stay in this hotel and i look forward to returning.  king street has restaurants and shops, cvs and dunkin donuts...the trolley is available to go to the waterfront and it is just beautiful. upon arrival, i was greeted by a very sweet and professional check-in staff member and given a token for a beverage because i had just missed cocktail hour.  how nice.  thank you again.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised comfortable accommodations, friendly staff, and convenient location with amenities."
the staff was tremendous at the monaco hotel in alexandria. from the front desk to the doormen to the hotel shuttle driver - they could not have been friendlier or more helpful. we enjoyed alexandria as well - a truly delightful town with great shops and eateries.,POSITIVE,Staff excellence and exceptional service across all departments impressed the guest.
"we visited alexandria, va over the 4th of july weekend. we had a great time, the town was very nice. the shops and restaurants we visited were very good. we enjoyed the marina and enjoyed the fireworks from there. we also enjoyed visiting the george washington masonic temple - great for all you dan brown enthusiasts! we stayed at the klimpton hotel (the location was perfect); however, the room we stayed in was extremely hot - the ac was barely working. on the bright side - the room was beautifully decorated.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised location, decor, and Alexandria attractions despite AC malfunction."
"we loved the hotel, and the neighborhood shopping and restaurants couldn't be beat! can't wait to stay there again.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised hotel quality, neighborhood shopping, and restaurants highly."
"my wife and i stayed a week with our granddaughter, to show her the nations capital. we were very happy with this hotel. the staff was friendly and helpful. they went out of their way to be friendly to haley, especially the doorman. she is 10 years old and loved it. the hotel was in beautiful condition. one exception, a small piece of marble was missing in one corner of the bathroom floor. hardly noticeable but, i noticed. the pool was great and had a lifeguard, awfully nice when traveling with a child. i missed having a spa but the work-out room was nice. doggy happy hour in the courtyard (yes lots of real dogs) was a hoot. i would definitely use this hotel again. both comfortable and convenient.",POSITIVE,"Staff excellence, family-friendly amenities, and overall comfort outweighed minor maintenance issue."
"this was my first visit to this hotel on a recommendation - loved it. beautiful room: comfy bed, great amenities, very helpful and nice staff. not too far from the metro (a little bit of a walk, but not too bad). wonderful little shops surrounding it. only thing missing was a continental breakfast in the morning, but there are plenty of little cafes surrounding to make up for that!",POSITIVE,"Guest praised room quality, staff helpfulness, and location amenities despite minor breakfast absence."
the staff was great. it was refreshing to stay in a swanky/modern style hotel as opposed to the more traditional looks of the others. we will definately go back!,POSITIVE,Great staff and modern hotel design impressed the guest positively.
it was excellent. staff courteous and helpful. afternoon wine was a party.,POSITIVE,"Courteous staff, helpful service, and enjoyable afternoon wine experience."
"we came in for our honeymoon, and they upgraded us to a larger terrace room. it was beautiful and the service was amazing. beautifully designed rooms and great amenities.",POSITIVE,"Guest praised room upgrade, service quality, design, and amenities."
"what can i say.... this hotel is beautiful, well appointed, in an excellent location, well maintained and is funky in it's design but charming and cosy all at the same time.all members of staff were friendly, attentive, helpful and pleasant to talk to. our room was impeccable, spotlessly clean and comfortable.the hotel is located on the main street in amongst the shops, bars, restaurants and only a 5/10 minute walk to the harbour. you would think that it would be noisy but i honestly didn't hear any noise from the main street.the indoor pool is small but it was clean and well maintained with a life guard on duty at all times.i really wished we had stayed here for longer, so if you're going to alexandria this hotel is a must!",POSITIVE,"Guest praised beautiful design, excellent location, friendly staff, and cleanliness throughout."
"i always stay at this hotel when i don't have to be in the center of dc. it is very accessible to dc via metro. 3 miles from reagan national airport, and easy trip to most anywhere else via metro or car. the monaco is in the center of restaurants and shops on king street. the hotel is great- super nice staff, fun decor, comfortable rooms and bathrooms, only tiny negative is that their workout room is really small and limited, however, they do have an indoor pool and there is a great running path along the river at the end of king street. no in room coffee but complimentary coffee served in the lobby in the morning and wine in the afternoon.",POSITIVE,"Guest praises staff, decor, rooms, amenities, and convenient location."
"first and foremost, it's a beautiful hotel in a great area. very comfortable room. but way to over priced for the stay. my only complaint is it so noisy!! constantly people walking and talking loudly in the rooms and hallways. up until 4:45am in the morning!! i could even hear the couple in the neighboring room have ""relations""! very short and loud!! if quietness was a guarantee, i would consider staying again.",NEGATIVE,Excessive noise disrupted sleep despite positive room and location qualities.
very nice very clean super trendy hotel! only complaint is that our bed was hard. very hard. we both woke up with a back ache.,POSITIVE,Guest praised cleanliness and trendy design despite bed comfort complaint.
"a 4 star rating tells you that a hotel has a keen eye for details and unexpected pleasures and smiles are expected. that is not this hotel. i booked because of experience with kimpton hotels in other cities. this one does not meet the kimpton standard. examples: showerhead that stays in one position (straight down because of faulty bracket), toilet that runs and hums long after the flush (don't think that's a feature), a totally dysfunctional internet, which they acknowledge was on the blink. overall, the hotel just needs some management attention and it could easily be brought up to standard 4 star. it is not at the moment a 4 star.",NEGATIVE,Multiple maintenance issues and unmet service standards disappointed guest expectations.
excellent kimpton hotel located in a lovely town. rooms furnished to a very high standard including luxurious bathroom. would certainly look to stay here again if visiting washington,POSITIVE,"Guest praised excellent hotel quality, luxurious rooms, and expressed intent to return."
"the staff is very friendly and helpful. the location is ideal. close to the strand.  there's a bus stop on the block for a free shuttle that goes up and down king st., but everything is close by so you can walk if you don't want to wait for the bus.only negative was that you could hear every sound in the hallway outside.  if i wasn't traveling by myself, maybe i wouldn't have noticed the noise so much.  i was by the elevators and could hear it ding as it went up and down; didn't matter if the elevator stopped on the floor or not.",POSITIVE,"Friendly staff, ideal location, and walkability outweigh minor noise issues."
very helpful staff. extremely convenient location. nice restaurant and bar.,POSITIVE,"Staff helpfulness, convenient location, and quality dining facilities impressed the guest."
