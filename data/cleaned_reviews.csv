the hotel was great. staff went above and beyond bringing hot tea to room at 11:30 pm at no charge!
"a wonderful hotel - would definitely stay there whenever we are in alexandria again.  wonderful staff.  we remarked that the first room was very far from the elevator, and they immediately moved us to a much nicer/larger room across from the elevator without question.  i hope i am able to stay at a kimpton hotel on future trips."
"i needed a place to stay in va that was close to or in alexandria and the monaco was available for a great value. i enjoyed my stay, room was comfortable and clean. was disappointed on parking cost but i was able to work around that. very convenient to old town."
"the hotel itself was very nice. the desk staff were very attentive and helpful. the rooms were nice but not dusted/cleaned adequately each day. the problems we had were few but definitely impacted whether we would stay there again. the hallways and elevators were not air-conditioned and were in the high 80's in july. also, with no complimentary breakfast offered, the free coffee was in high demand. the coffee hours ended at 9:00 a.m. and the coffee was always empty, missing ""to go"" cups, or out of cream and sugar. a daily conversation with the desk staff on this issue grew tiresome with our 7 day stay. look elsewhere if service is important to you."
"we arrive around 1 am,  for a 5 night stay, and the lady could not find our reservation. after a while she she found it but could not tell us a thing about our expedia gold benefits. she told us it was not her problem a we should ask the manager eventually."
"excellent location, good value, clean and comfortable room. what more could you ask for?!"
"overall the stay was fine. room was clean, bed & pillow were comfortable, nice toiletries and towels. check in was a little slow, but staff in the lobby were nice. however, the ac unit is loud & in the room. the mini fridge is somewhat noisy. and the toilet kept running every 10 minutes (loudest filling toilet ever). and the headboard had seen some damage (fake leather). the location is great though. short walk to harbor area, lots of restaurants, etc."
"the room was very nice and clean. the hotel was uniquely decorated and stylish. the location was nice if you plan to go out in old town, but a good 20+ minute walk to public transportation and a hike to get into dc."
"the hotel exceeded our expectations. our room and the hotel was well kept, clean and the decor tasteful.the 5 p.m. manager hosted wine tasting is an excellent way to return to the hotel after a nice day out to see the sites and touring. it was also a great ice breaker to meet other guests (or not).to top it off this particular property is perfectly located on king street in historic alexandria surrounded by shops and excellent choices of restaurants.we will definitely stay here again and will recommend to friends."
"from check in to check out the staff goes out of its way to insure that your stay is problem free. beautiful rooms, excellent staff, great location. we go to alexandria 2-3 times a year to enjoy the history and would not think of staying elsewhere. it is located right in the heart of old alexandria and within walking distance of everything."
lovely. stayed there for the inauguration and the staff was on top of their game. very attentive despite a packed house and also lots of sweet touches like shuttles to the metro on inauguration day etc.went on to stay at the monaco in chicago and was so disappointed by the service after a wonderful stay at the monaco in alexandria.
"the hotel is right in the heart of old town alexandria on king street. shops, bakeries and wonderful restaurants lined the street. the 1 mile walk to the metro gave us plenty of opportunities to window shop. the staff was great. our room was a little on the small side, but for 2 nights we were more than satisfied. highly recommended."
"my daughter and i had our first get-away alone since she started her family. we live in baltimore so the journey was short.  i love this hotel and its lovely staff, great wine reception, dog-friendliness.  we enjoyed the large pool and sat in front of the reception fire place to warm up and meet interesting guests."
"great hotel, great location, excellent room...thermometor in room did not register correct temperature, too hot to sleep, the hallway was colder than our room.we had it set on the lowest setting it would go.also, the key card would not work the first time, and as petty as it sounds, i had to walk all the way back downstairs, wait in line and then hope the key would work when i went back upstairs.in this day and age, all hotels should have free internet, at least in the lobby.looked clean, but i dropped an ear ring back close to the edge of the bed, when i picked it up, there were ""things"" clinging to it, needed better vacuuming?"
"we chose this hotel because kimpton's have a great reputation and they are pet friendly. upon arrival (around 9pm) we were disappointed that there was no door staff/valet etc so we ended up taking in the luggage ourselves. when the bellman did see me they didn't offer to help. check-in was quick and front desk girl was very friendly, greeted dori by name and offered her a pet package. the room was large and comfortable but there were some areas where you can see the hotel is showing some wear and tear. overall still very good. all the amenities of a kimpton including 4pm kids hour, 5pm wine hour and most importantly for us pet friendly. the hotel was very busy as it was memorial day weekend so the restaurant and room service had delays but that's to be expected. i would choose this hotel again especially for the proximity of being in the middle of old town, several blocks from the water front and in the midst of amazing restaurants like restaurant eve."
"very friendly staff; good location. child and pet friendly. great swimming pool. nice, interesting decor; clean. overall, a very good hotel."
"the room was clean and very nice. the bed and pillows were perfect. the only issue was checkout...they overcharged me for parking. it wasn't listed on final receipt and i would've never known if i didn't check my credit card statement (this wasn't the credit card holding charge). quickly resolved, but still a hassle and the reason for less than 5 stars"
excellent location and friendly staff. we loved the free wine and snacks from 5-6 nightly
my only real complaint is why pay for parking & 2 use the internet on your own cell? shouldn't that be on the hotel? just a thought
great value for the money. convenient location in old town close to many fun things.
"we arrived late and the hotel staff couldn't have been nicer or more efficient.  we were settled in our room in less than 10 minutes.  when i couldn't connect to wifi, a call to the front desk resulted in a knock on our door within two minutes.  i had some special needs, and the staff did an excellent job of meeting them.  the hotel is perfect for a stay in alexandria."
"had an amazing stay. clean hotel, very friendly staff!!!"
"i was expecting a typical kimpton stay - wine and hors d'oeurves at 5 pm in the ""living room"", but found out when we got there they didn't do that because of some abc laws in alexandria - though the embassy suites does offer it. room service breakfast was quite expensive... on the flip side - the location cannot be beat - right on the free trolley route and close to all old town alexandria awesomeness!!!"
a wonderful 2 night stay in hotel monaco alexandria. room was decorated beautifully. bathroom was luxurious with all the amenties. bed was wonderful and comfortable. hotel was right in the heart of old town with no reason to move/use the car. staff was always great. i particularly liked that the staff at the door always welcomed me back or wished me a nice day. and that staff in other locations always made eye contact/smiled/had a positive comment.only tiny negative was finding a previous patron's leftovers in the mini fridge.
"i booked through this third-party site, paid extra for a room with a balcony & made a notation in the ""notes"" section that we'd like a roll-away bed for a child if it was available (the website said they were available on a first-come basis). when i arrived, without warning, the bellhop led us to a standard double room (the cheapest type, with no balcony). i explained to him that we'd reserved a room w/ a balcony, he called the front desk and they told him none was available. he handed the phone to me & i asked the girl on the other end if i could speak to a manager. he was rude, did not apologize for the situation, & flatly told me that because i had booked through a certain third-party reservation site, there was nothing he could do about the error. he eventually clarified that since i had booked a room with one bed (albeit a king), but had asked for a second bed, they simply changed the reservation to a double room. he said there was no way to notify me of this, because the third-party reservation company does not supply the names or phone numbers of people who make reservations. he had no explanation for how the hotel front-desk staff had been able to match my name & id to a reservation. anyway, he refused to refund the difference in the price of the room. he offered to put us in a room with a balcony the next day. he told me to start calling them the next day at about noon to see if one would be available. one eventually did come available the next day at 5 p.m. & we took it. it was too dark to even see the balcony (half the point of a balcony room was to have the extra sunlight). i complained about it long enough that an hour later, someone showed up with a free bottle of wine & an apology letter for the ""miscommunication"", but there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the rooms, & the bad customer service made the trip a little worse than it needed to be.our first room on the 6th (top) floor had too little water pressure to take a good shower. other than that, the hotel itself was perfectly nice. hopefully the manager moves on. i may try it again next time i'm in the area, but i would not recommend booking this hotel through a discount hotel website."
nice hotel in a beautiful area of washington. room needs a bit of a refurbishment (e.g. heating unit made an terribly loud noise as it shut on and off during the night) and the gym needs upgrading.
thoroughly enjoyed our stay. loved early evening wine in the lobby and it was great fun that the hotel is dog friendly even though we didn't have a dog with us.
the hotel was in a great location. the rooms were beautiful and very clean. the customer service was outstanding!!! it was nice to be greeted by name without them having to look at my credit card first!
"we had a great night at the monaco.  i have stayed at both this one and the one in downtown dc.  love them both.  great people, management, and hotel.  we will be back."
we had a wonderful stay. rooms are large and very clean. all of the staff were super friendly and extremely helpful in all regards.
this hotel is well located in a very attractice and historical site. rooms are kind of small but comfortable. service is excellent and staff very friendly.the restaurant has an excellent menu and seems to be popular among locals.
"the stay was good, price of the room was too expensive for the hotel. i have stayed in others in the area for less than half the price, that had more services and free parking. don't think i will recommend or stay there again."
"this hotel used to be a holiday inn -- the hotel is limited by that configuration.  monaco has tried to make it a boutique hotel and have done a pretty good job, but it is not a four star hotel.  i would give it three stars.  other than that, they try hard, did a good job, and we were quite satisfied with staff, location, and cleanliness."
"the staff were attentive, but the cleaning staff were a touch impolite at times.the restaurant served decent breakfast. parking was quite expensive, at $27 a day."
"king st is amazing. my wife called it a clean bourbon street. i agree. it is not as raucous (good thing) and there are tons of restaurants and shops within walking distance. also, the whole old towne alexandria is very inviting."
we only stayed one night but it was wonderful. staff was very friendly and accommodating. room was clean beautiful comfortable we felt as though we were at home. location is very nice nice to walk around with the shops close to the water. we would stay here again in a heartbeat.
"beautiful hotel - cozy room, nicely appointed and clean. love the wine happy hour! great location and friendly staff. will definitely stay there again."
"when we go back to dc we usually stay at the monaco because of its location.  if my husband has to take the car for a meeting, i can walk to the shops and restaurants and i feel completely comfortable there.  when we are together, it's convenient to everything we need to get to, our old neighborhood, good restaurants and the major highways.this past weekend, there were a lot of little kids and dogs, i guess because it was a holiday weekend.  we heard dogs barking and kids crying, didn't bother us too much since it was during the day, if it disturbed our sleep this review might have had a different ending."
"this hotel is located in old town, alexandria, va. it is a renovated older hotel but the rooms were quite nice with marble sink and tile in the bath and nicely done d��cor. the hotel offers free shuttle service from reagan international, but it only runs every hour. however, if you call the hotel they will let you know where and when to meet the shuttle. they offer complementary coffee and tea each morning and a wine bar each evening although we did not use the latter. there are many restaurants near the hotel including a very nice french caf�� next door. if you are a kimpton rewards member, you can even receive a coupon good for $10 worth of items from the mini-bar in your room. the only negative was that the hotel is about a mile from the king st. metro stop which provides the quickest and least expensive access to washington, d.c.all things considered we would definitely consider staying there again during future visits."
"the staff was friendly and helpful and the room was very comfortable, clean and quiet. the location was convenient to basically everything (food, shopping, entertainment, transportation) in alexandria."
"the hotel was a great location, walking distance to so much.  staff was very helpful."
have stayed at this hotel many times and the staff is personable & committed to excellence. kimpton's ability to identify quality individuals from diverse backgrounds and then have a top notch traing program is reflected in each stay.
"this hotel has a nice charm; not your cookie cutter luxury hotel. the staff was nice, the location in old town is perfect."
"all shopping and restaurants are short walks from the hotel.  the best location of any hotel in alexandria.  the staff was most accommodating.  one day, my wife and i decided to go for a walk along king street.  a member of the hotel staff ran to us with an umbrella in hand.  he suggested we talk it in the event of rain.  we look forward to a return visit to the hotel monaco in the near future."
we had a fantastic time and highly recommend this hotel for families. the pool was fab and so was the happy hour for kids and adults.
did recon for our wedding next year. will definitely have our guests stay here.
"this hotel is located ideally right in the heart of old town alexandria, va.  it made it the perfect place to stay and see the sights.  we loved the quaint surroundings and the hotel staff and check-in process couldn't be more pleasant and efficient.  we would whole-heartedly recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting alexandria or the wash. dc area."
"a complimentary bottle of water and maybe a small coffee maker in the room would be nice.overall, i was very pleased."
"after reading about the hotel monaco online, i changed my reservation at the marriott, and i was very glad that i did. you would expect to pay a lot more for this hotel that what our room rate was. the kimpton hotels are so cool - loved the room decorations, efficient bathroom, comfy beds and lively lobby. being a pet friendly hotel, it didn't smell. the outside furniture in the courtyard area was so relaxing at night. the menu for dinner was a bit different than what we expected and i would not eat there again. i loved this hotel and would stay there again when i go to old town to visit my son and his fiance."
"we couldn't have been happier with our stay. the staff was uniformly friendly and kind, the room was great (a bit more creatively decorated than your typical hotel), and you just can't beat the location. we were just a few blocks from just about everything we wanted to do. (oh... and they have an indoor pool that we got a *lot* of use out of.)i wasn't expecting anything other than another cookie-cutter hotel, and i was really surprised at how wrong i was."
"this was a fun, chic hotel in the perfect location for a night out on the old town."
"the monaco is very well situated, near the king street shops and the waterfront. that is its best asset. also, particularly good is the service. the staff are welcoming and always helpful. otherwise, the hotel is standard for a premium hotel. the closets are a little cramped, but the windows open and the room temperature is well controlled. i have a personal dislike of duvets, but the hotel furnished the proper blanket."
great hotel in great location but expensive rooms and parking. could have stayed a few blocks west on king street for $100 less a night had i known that bus service on king street is free and frequent. the two beds in our room where very narrow for two and who wants to sleep in separate beds?
"if you drive a car, then you shuld feel comportable and meet nice front desk. most of all, my family colud have good sleep on the very nice bed and bedclothes. near from the hotel, very good restaurants are there. don't worry about your breakfast and dinner with walking."
"great place to stay, super price for the service. attitude of hotel staff made the stay the best we've had in a long time. looking foward to next visit to dc"
the staff is top notch. there is a big difference in the size of the rooms (same price) the rooms that face king street are much larger then the interior rooms. it's a shame that there isn't any outdoor patio furniture
overall we were pleased with our stay. the only downfall was that we had asked to be notified once our room was ready we had arrived about an hour before check in. when we contacted hotel staff around 45 minutes after allowed check in time we were told our room had been ready. very frustrating on a cold rainy day when we just wanted to get settled.
this was a perfect base camp for touring dc. the metro station was within walking distance and a trolley was also available for getting to and from the metro. on the way to the metro station are lots of unique shops and restaurants. the area was totally safe for walking. the hotel is very close to the waterfront and the torpedo factory art center and the street entertainment in that area. located on king street this is a beautiful area to come back to after the bustle of dc. i hope to return again next year and will definitely stay in this hotel. wish we had had more time. highly recommend this beautiful hotel.
"the hotel had great service. the bathroom was newly remodeled, so was absolutely beautiful. the best part was the location - conveniently located to great restaurants, bakeries, metro, and the river."
"i stayed here a month ago, liked it so much that we returned here on our most recent trip. i didn't mention the daily wine reception with interesting wines in my last review. it is a nice event at 5pm daily in the lobby. creatively decorated rooms with a good bed for a restful nights sleep, great location for old town alexandria."
"excellent service throughout the hotel including the front desk, room service, jackson 20, bell service. the sleeping rooms are enchanting and relatively large. close to great shopping and restaurants and nightlife."
"the room was very elegant and cozy. we enjoyed our room decor quite a lot ! parking was an unexpected difficulty, and frankly started our visit off in an unhappy way. we couldn't even pull up to the hotel in our car due to its position in the street. there is a tiny amount of space for cars to pull into the valet area in the front of the hotel. once that area is filled with 2-3 cars, there is no where to even pull your vehicle to check in and unload the car. you end up in some garage down the street. also, the front desk was not helpful when they kept repeating in half broken english, ""the valet will help you, the valet will take care of you""-- yeah, maybe if we could get our car anywhere near them!however, once we finally got to out room, it was lovely. the rest of the staff was very courteous. i didn't appreciate the attitude if the woman at the front desk, but i still enjoyed my stay."
"my husband and i stayed here at a friends recommendation and loved every minute of it. the hotel is excellent and in a great location. plenty of places to eat and shop close by. the only negative i have to say is the free trolley is not a reliable form of transportation. we walked to the king street metro station (14 blocks away) more than we road the trolley, but the walk was beautiful and peaceful. everyone around was super friendly. we are already talking about going back soon!!"
the room was so nice and comfortable.  just a fabulous hotel.  food was fantastic in the restaurant.  close to everything i wanted and a great price too.
"you can't beat the location. old town alexandria is charming, and the hotel is right in the middle of it. there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. the restaurant next to the hotel is a bit spendy, but pretty good. the room itself was a bit small, and i would have liked a lock on the bathroom door, but the beds and pillows were comfy, and the tv service adequate. going into downtown d.c. was ~50 minutes door-to-door (to white house) by metro. i feel the hotel should offer a shuttle to the metro. we had to taxi, since the king street trolley only runs from 11am - 7pm--walking to the metro, while doable at 20m, would have made for a tiring day touring d.c. the parking garage is old and space is tight, so a couple nights we had to pay to park elsewhere, but its workable. most staff were nice, but a few times the staff were slightly less than helpful: room service comes too late in the day, and kept harassing us even though our child was napping and we asked them to come back later. one day while it was pouring rain outside, we tried to borrow an extra umbrella from the doorman (we're a family of 4 with 2 young kids), and were rebuffed [??]. but, the kids hour and wine hour are great, and the hotel is fun. bottom line, the location is great, and the charm of the hotel and the surrounding area make some of the small inconveniences insignificant."
"i thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. it was just for one night, and there was nothing negative. the location, staff, room - everything was just fine. my friends and i enjoyed happy hour in the lobby and an excellent dinner in the hotel's restaurant."
this hotel was just charming. the decor was modern and eclectic and somewhat whimsical. everything was spotlessly clean. the bed was comfortable and the linens luxurious. i would recommend this to anyone.
"this is a very nice, comfortable hotel. the service is excellent and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. nice location in old town alexandria about a mile from the king st. metro station (shuttles to and from the hotel available by simply calling the concierge).we highly recommend this to anyone."
great stay. perfect location in the heart of old town. we upgraded to the small suite with balcony. totally worth it!
we really liked this hotel. it was relaxing and we enjoyed our stay.
"we couldn't have chosen a better hotel.  it's within walking distance of everything, the staff was very attentive and the rooms had a very nice charm to them. the only (small) issue we had is that ac unit was a bit loud - but since we are getting to the warmer days, it is expected that the unit needs to work hard to keep the room at a certain temperature. we thought it was really convenient that they provided little items that are easily forgotten: toothbrush/paste, phone charger, etc - upon request."
"wasn't informed of $27 parking fee at time of booking, found out about that at check in. room seemed closed in and dark, needs updating. shower curtain was dirty, looked like someone blew their nose on it. stained throw pillow and towel. mattress was horribly uncomfortable, both myself and my wife spent a restless night. forget the gym, the weight set is too complicated for a good workout and of the 5 pieces of cardio equipment, 1 functioned properly. the overall area had little to offer, unless you are into art. homeless people were sleeping in doorways 30 feet from the doors of the hotel in the morning. would not recommend this hotel to anyone. wish we hadn't wasted our time and money on this hotel. when we informed the staff of the condition of our room, we were met with an oh. thanks for nothing."
"this hotel is perfectly situated in old town alexandria, va   it is in the heart of town next to many restaurants and historic places.  with a rollaway bed and two double beds, my sons and a friend were easily accommodated in one room.  always a pleasure to be at this site.  some very small updates in the room do need to be done."
everyone was very helpful. i had an excellent experience and stay.
"as a business traveler, i absolutely love staying at this hotel. not only are the rooms comfortable and tastefully decorated, but the service is fantastic. the lobby is the ""place to be,"" with plenty of action, wine hour, and coffee/tea in the mornings. the location is perfect for me as well, with an unending supply of great restaurants and bars within walking distance. i also like the small touches in the room, like a hair dryer, extra space, and robes."
"we drove into town for the cherry blossoms festival in d.c., but didn't want to stay in $300+ hotels in the city...that's where monaco provided the much needed relaxing atmosphere for this one-night stay and all the amenities and comfort that one might need. awesome shower and comfy bed (two of my critical features), as well as location in the middle of alexandria's shopping & restaurant district made this stay very memorable. helpful staff at the front desk was a pleasant bonus, as well."
very relaxing  and close to restaurants and the waterfront.  easy access to the water taxi to dc
we were pleasantly surprised by the decor and size of our room. we stayed in a double bed guestroom and had plenty of space. the bathroom was spacious and very clean. the pool area had plenty of windows that opened up and the fresh air was nice. i would highly recommend this hotel to couples and families.
"staying in old town alexandria was great--the area has so much to offer in terms of restaurants, unique shopping, and historic character. i was there for a whole week, so had lots of opportunity to interact with staff when coming and going--especially since i had a car in valet parking. they were extremely friendly and personable, addressing me by name after the first day there. the atmosphere of the hotel was very inviting. the restaurant was also good--although the quantities were huge, so i found myself leaving food on the plate. the room would be better if it had an arm chair or someplace else to sit--there was an odd large ottoman, but it was not a good place to watch tv from or read. other than that, everything was very nice."
"from the time we walked into the hotel until we left with our bags after check out, the staff at this location was nothing less than fantastic! they made us feel important and addressed any concern we had with immediate attention. i was filling out a survey about the hotel, and left a less than satisfied mark on the questionnaire. within 5 minutes, i received a call from the front desk and an email. my problem? we were 20 mins away from where our plans were. even though it had nothing to do with them, this hotel was all about making our visit enjoyable. kudos to the front desk, cleaning staff, and everyone else that works at this place!"
lovely boutique hotel that is located in heart of old alexandria.  good for children and adults with quick foods close by and coffee in lobby.  wonderfully located and personnel were delightful and helpful.
"my wife and i stayed here for a weekend get away. the hotel is awesome! great staff, really cool vibe and great location. the hotel is pet friendly so we saw some pretty cool dogs and surprisingly we didn't hear any barking at night ( i was a little concerned about that). there's so much to see and do within walking distance. we valeted our car for $25 and walked everywhere. so overall it's a great place to stay. a few little critiques: 1. some of the fixtures in our room we loose or broken. 2. the fridge is locked and you have to ask for the key. kinda odd. it's stocked full of wine, beer and liquor, plus some snacks and even socks! but there's no room to put anything of your own in there ( i know, i know, it's wet bar, but one shelf would be great). we didn't buy anything, but everything is reasonably priced. - so the bottom line is, we will be back!"
"this is a prime example of how great the unpublished rates can be! plush, spacious room with luxury amenities such as marble bathrooms, a big deep bathtub, overstuffed chaise lounge chairs, dreamlike bedding, beautiful decor. rooms like these truly make leaving home and sleeping elsewhere a treat that one can look forward to."
"located on king st., shopping and all amenities available. comfortable and beautiful accommodations with a very friendly staff.  whenever i need to be in dc, i choose to stay in this hotel and i look forward to returning.  king street has restaurants and shops, cvs and dunkin donuts...the trolley is available to go to the waterfront and it is just beautiful. upon arrival, i was greeted by a very sweet and professional check-in staff member and given a token for a beverage because i had just missed cocktail hour.  how nice.  thank you again."
the staff was tremendous at the monaco hotel in alexandria. from the front desk to the doormen to the hotel shuttle driver - they could not have been friendlier or more helpful. we enjoyed alexandria as well - a truly delightful town with great shops and eateries.
"we visited alexandria, va over the 4th of july weekend. we had a great time, the town was very nice. the shops and restaurants we visited were very good. we enjoyed the marina and enjoyed the fireworks from there. we also enjoyed visiting the george washington masonic temple - great for all you dan brown enthusiasts! we stayed at the klimpton hotel (the location was perfect); however, the room we stayed in was extremely hot - the ac was barely working. on the bright side - the room was beautifully decorated."
"we loved the hotel, and the neighborhood shopping and restaurants couldn't be beat! can't wait to stay there again."
"my wife and i stayed a week with our granddaughter, to show her the nations capital. we were very happy with this hotel. the staff was friendly and helpful. they went out of their way to be friendly to haley, especially the doorman. she is 10 years old and loved it. the hotel was in beautiful condition. one exception, a small piece of marble was missing in one corner of the bathroom floor. hardly noticeable but, i noticed. the pool was great and had a lifeguard, awfully nice when traveling with a child. i missed having a spa but the work-out room was nice. doggy happy hour in the courtyard (yes lots of real dogs) was a hoot. i would definitely use this hotel again. both comfortable and convenient."
"this was my first visit to this hotel on a recommendation - loved it. beautiful room: comfy bed, great amenities, very helpful and nice staff. not too far from the metro (a little bit of a walk, but not too bad). wonderful little shops surrounding it. only thing missing was a continental breakfast in the morning, but there are plenty of little cafes surrounding to make up for that!"
the staff was great. it was refreshing to stay in a swanky/modern style hotel as opposed to the more traditional looks of the others. we will definately go back!
it was excellent. staff courteous and helpful. afternoon wine was a party.
"we came in for our honeymoon, and they upgraded us to a larger terrace room. it was beautiful and the service was amazing. beautifully designed rooms and great amenities."
"what can i say.... this hotel is beautiful, well appointed, in an excellent location, well maintained and is funky in it's design but charming and cosy all at the same time.all members of staff were friendly, attentive, helpful and pleasant to talk to. our room was impeccable, spotlessly clean and comfortable.the hotel is located on the main street in amongst the shops, bars, restaurants and only a 5/10 minute walk to the harbour. you would think that it would be noisy but i honestly didn't hear any noise from the main street.the indoor pool is small but it was clean and well maintained with a life guard on duty at all times.i really wished we had stayed here for longer, so if you're going to alexandria this hotel is a must!"
"i always stay at this hotel when i don't have to be in the center of dc. it is very accessible to dc via metro. 3 miles from reagan national airport, and easy trip to most anywhere else via metro or car. the monaco is in the center of restaurants and shops on king street. the hotel is great- super nice staff, fun decor, comfortable rooms and bathrooms, only tiny negative is that their workout room is really small and limited, however, they do have an indoor pool and there is a great running path along the river at the end of king street. no in room coffee but complimentary coffee served in the lobby in the morning and wine in the afternoon."
"first and foremost, it's a beautiful hotel in a great area. very comfortable room. but way to over priced for the stay. my only complaint is it so noisy!! constantly people walking and talking loudly in the rooms and hallways. up until 4:45am in the morning!! i could even hear the couple in the neighboring room have ""relations""! very short and loud!! if quietness was a guarantee, i would consider staying again."
very nice very clean super trendy hotel! only complaint is that our bed was hard. very hard. we both woke up with a back ache.
"a 4 star rating tells you that a hotel has a keen eye for details and unexpected pleasures and smiles are expected. that is not this hotel. i booked because of experience with kimpton hotels in other cities. this one does not meet the kimpton standard. examples: showerhead that stays in one position (straight down because of faulty bracket), toilet that runs and hums long after the flush (don't think that's a feature), a totally dysfunctional internet, which they acknowledge was on the blink. overall, the hotel just needs some management attention and it could easily be brought up to standard 4 star. it is not at the moment a 4 star."
excellent kimpton hotel located in a lovely town. rooms furnished to a very high standard including luxurious bathroom. would certainly look to stay here again if visiting washington
"the staff is very friendly and helpful. the location is ideal. close to the strand.  there's a bus stop on the block for a free shuttle that goes up and down king st., but everything is close by so you can walk if you don't want to wait for the bus.only negative was that you could hear every sound in the hallway outside.  if i wasn't traveling by myself, maybe i wouldn't have noticed the noise so much.  i was by the elevators and could hear it ding as it went up and down; didn't matter if the elevator stopped on the floor or not."
very helpful staff. extremely convenient location. nice restaurant and bar.
located steps from the best of old town and incredibly comfortable stay.
"hotel is in a good location if traveling to dc. there is a free trolley service that runs in the early afternoon to the metro station. the rooms are comfortable, but they need to turn their mattresses over because if your in a king size bed you may find yourself sleeping in a ""ditch"". our son slept in the lounge chair because of its novelty but the hotel provided us with a roll-away bed when we asked. the hotel pool on the third floor was fine but the only hiccup was that it is closed from 11-2pm.  the area has a large selection of restaurants surrounding the hotel so no problem getting a bite to eat. complementary morning coffee was a plus. a good choice for all type of travel, even if you bring your dog. really enjoyed our trip."
"it started poorly. the shuttle went right by us at the airport. the hotel was quick to suggest we take a taxi , which they reimbursed us for.  we were early but they graciously showed us to our room.the room was rather small and a little scruffy. they give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were very thick and hard. the staff was good and the location is great"
"we would only add this:i was afraid the fish was not feed in my room - it caused stress for me - my fault i asked for the fish..but bertha needed attention and i would suggest a tag to when the ""requested"" fish is fed/tended to so guest actually enjoy the fish and dont worry about its care - just a thought : )parking - we assumed parking would be included on our 3 night stay. that might have been better explained/represented. we could have had dinner at that cost alone.everything was great - staff superior - but do address above for complete comfort/satisfaction of future guest.thankssyn & cin"
"the minute we walked in we loved this hotel. parking, staff, interiors, convenience all top notch. we had no idea what we were getting into being from las vegas and booking sight unseen. our daughter's joined us from va and nc and loved everything! it was so easy to hop on the water taxi, trolley and metro to dc without the high price. we could not have asked for a better stay. also, dog friendly."
"very happy with our stay. the room was a little smaller than what i expected but it could have just been the room we were in. other than that, great location on king st. near alot of shops and restaurants. definately would go there again."
lovely hotel that has a staff that always goes beyond the ordinary to make your stay special. don't miss the free wine reception at five!  a great place to meet your fellow travelers.  take on the pool of you have time.  lots to see and do on king street!  the hotel has its own fleet of bikes.  take a ride down to mt vernon!  or take a boat ride to national harbor.
"this is obviously the hipster hotel option in old town and while the hotel looks lovely and is decorated nicely i was very underwhelmed.i arrived on a totally freezing windy night, i saw two door guys standing inside the door watching me take my bags out and they just stood there.the don't mention self park and automatically valet'd my car. when i called for my car, i was told 5-10 minutes by the desk clerk. i went to the lobby in 10 and sat there for 20 more minutes. not one staff member asked if they could help me or if i needed my car as i sat with my yellow ticket in hand. when i finally went to the desk to ask it was still a further 10 minutes before my car was brought up. i would have been happy to self park, if only i had been aware of the availability. you can exit the room and go straight to your car from the main elevators.the room was freezing, the unit made so much noise that it woke me up every time it cycled on and off. there were no extra blankets available in the room and so i spent my first night awake and freezing. i asked via a note the next day for housekeeping to leave an extra. the fried was also loud. i was next to the elevators which pinged all night. there���s no sound proofing and you can hear every conversation happening in the hallway. i used to think i was one of those youngish types who would frequent this type of hotel but i guess not as i'd be considerate not to make my evening plans loudly outside someone's room at 11pm."
"the hotel is located in a great location, lots of restaurants, bars, and cool shops. the hotel lobby was very cozy and the complementary glass of wine every evening was a nice touch. the room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very uncomfortable. i can usually sleep on just about anything, but actually woke up every morning with a sore back. also, one day i returned to find the housekeeping staff had cleaned the room but left the door open. very disappointing. the restaurant was average, it seems like the focus is on the famous chef's name and maybe not the food. overall though, the staff was very helpful."
"accommodations were excellent. every staff member was courteous and appeared sincerely interested in offering good service, including the concierge and doormen."
we found a public parking garage within 2 blocks of the hotel that charged $4 per day.
"close to national airport. wonderful hotel with free shuttle, helpful front desk and all staff service! put creativity and festive spirit to my business trip to dc.  i could take care of computer, efficient commute between airport and dc, and enjoy the hotel!"
"every once in a while, a visit to a hotel is just positive from start to finish.  this was one of those such stays.  available parking was reasonable, with in/out privs and no penalty.  the staff was very friendly, and helpful.  their food recommendations were outstanding.  the location was perfect, near plenty of food and shopping and easy to get to.  the room was very quiet, and spotless.  kimpton always does a great job.  i would have a hard time finding something to complain about."
"kind of eccentric hotel, but very comfortable, reasonably priced for the area and a short walk to all the sites ni old town. pet friendly, but has ""no pet"" floors for people (like us) who aren't in love with everyone else's dog. great service. definitely not the ""big box"" hotels that are all the same. will definitely give it another visit next time i am in alexandria."
hotel wifi not strong. could not get service. also many tv channels scrambled parking too expensive for that area
comfortable and convenient hotel with adjoining restaurant. located in shopping and restaurant area and within walking distance to the potomac. very convenient shuttle to reagan airport takes only 15 minutes!
wrong rooms the room i booked was not the room i was placed in they then put me in another room which still was the one i paid for i was refunded the difference in the morning but of the few times ive stayed there that was the first bad experience
"lovely property, attentive staff! so glad i stayed at this property. this town is so charming and relaxing. only a few minutes away to the dc convention center. would love to return and would definitely recomend."
"we like this hotel for its spacious room and perfect location opposite of the city hall. and our room is at the side room, very quiet."
they did have any queen or king bed rooms available only double rooms even though i had a reservation for a king bed room.  all they did to compensate for it was offer us a free continental breakfast which is just coffee and pastries.  i asked for a refund for our room since i had already paid for it and the guy behind the desk said he couldn't help me with that since i booked it on expedia.  we ended up walking down the street in 10 degree weather to another hotel owned by the same franchise.  when i told them what happened they at least apologized and the lady behind the desk even offered to email expedia for me to get my refund which is what the first guy should have done.  i'm not sure if all hotels oversell their rooms but i would not recommend this hotel for that reason.
"this was one of the most charming hotels that i ever visited. the staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful. i will definitely stay there when i am in the alexandria, va area!"
"my husband and i had a lovely second anniversary stay at the hotel monaco. from the friendly doormen who greeted us to the detailed decorating in our clean and welcoming room, i felt like someone else had thought through the details for my stay so i could just relax and enjoy our vacation.if you visit, make sure to check out the accompanying restaurant, jackson 20. we had the eggs chesapeake and the tall stack (pancakes, real maple syrup, bacon, and hash browns)... both of which were incredibly delightful and satisfying. the best breakfast we've had while traveling for quite a while!"
the hotel was very nice and the experience was enjoyable. we got a king bed when we only expected a queen. there are many dogs at the hotel which was fine for us because we like dogs. the concierge we spoke to sent us to a restaurant that was closed for business which seemed a little unprofessional. other than that we had a great experience! love the town
"from the moment i walked in i was greeted by name, offered complimentary beverages, assisted to my room, and had all my travel/entertainment questions answered before i was completely checked in. although the design of the hotel not as retro and fun as their helix hotel counterpart in washington dc, what they lacked in style they definetely made up for in service."
"the monaco was a great option for my business travel.  the location was convenient, with nice amenities, and exception service by the hotel staff.  an all around great kimpton experience."
another getaway to old town and love this hotel stayed another night with help from calvin at the front desk!! he was so helpful
"this is a 3.5 star hotel that is in a great location. the beds at this hotel are very comfortable, rooms have good amount of space. the decor is tired and the furniture has seen better days. stains on the furniture chairs, wallpaper pealing off in the rooms and in the hallways. the bathroom double doors leaves little privacy. the most disappointing was the lack of cleanliness in the bathroom. while taking a shower (that has great water pressure), you pull back the shower curtain and the liner is loaded with hair that is not yours. i stayed at this hotel for 5 night. i asked the front desk on my first night if they could empty out the mini refrigerator of it's over priced items. this never happened. i just left everything on top of the tv stand. house keeping never got the message or the hint that i left. why is it that a hotel 6 don't charge for internet or parking but when you pay over $180.00 a night for a hotel you will pay for all separately."
"everything is lovely except no one came to clean the room or change the towels, this is with two teenagers.  we had asked the cleaning staff that were nearby early in the morning, but nothing happened. so about 5:00 pm we asked the front desk who did take care of it"
"very nice hotel with great service and helpful staff. check-out time is convenient, location is very good, valet parking was extremely convenient. if i had to nitpick and complain about something, it would be difficult to find anything that is a valid complaint."
"the hotel monaco is a beautiful place to stay. the lobby is wonderful. the elevators well decorated. marble throughout the hotel. very impressive. however, after returning from a wonderful day on the town, having dinner and a few drinks, this is where our stay turned sour. unbeknown to us, the room air conditioner wasn't working well at keeping the room cool! after looking at the room temperature control, the climate settings only allow a range from 65 degrees and a high of 73 sweating all night! horrible night sleep! ceiling fan would have helped. for the price, i thought someone would have checked to see if we were comfortable. we decided to relocate elsewhere. very disappointed."
"stayed for the first time in this area of the country. my husband and i traveled with two small children, and found that the hotel was very accomadating. i was so impressed by the small details that every staff member took to make sure that our stay was excellent. there was someone there with a smile to help load and unload luggage, park the car, and they even took the time to have the crib in our hotel room before we checked in. not once did i have anyone that was less than professional approach me. i would recommend this hotel to anyone that is traveling and demands a four star hotel for your family."
great place to stay. enjoyed the location. the hotel was clean and uprayed.
ac in rooms blasting so loud that my bed that was next to the unit was literally shacking. the manager tried to switch me to different rooms but they are all the same. i have lost 3 nights of sound sleep. i will never stay in this hotel again
"great service, beautiful hotel, friendly & knowledgable staff, as well as an excellent location! i will be visiting this hotel again!"
"great spacious rooms, very clean hotel, great location and nice staff.  the onsite restaurant was great for breakfast."
went to a show at the birchmere. second time we've stayed at hotel monaco. great place!
"i wish i could give this place a better review, since i love kimpton hotels, but unfortunately the monaco did not live up to our expectations. - snarly woman behind the counter gave us attitude when we tried to check in 45 min early. we were happy to wait and could have lived without the unpleasantness. - took 20 minutes and two phone calls to get our luggage up to the room after we were able to get in; on top of that they misplaced a very large pregnancy pillow that was placed in the office for safe-keeping. we finally had to walk down to find and retrieve it ourselves. - found a black hair under the comforter upon arrival. - we were out of the room for at least 7 hours during the next day and no one cleaned our room. - the tv picture flickered on almost every channel. - we asked for a cart to bring our luggage down at checkout and no one came after 20 min. finally had to go down to get one ourselves. downstairs, an empty cart was sitting next to several bellhops who were chatting away to one another."
"wonderful location - however - many hotel guests with service animals - some of which were just simply large dogs.  housekeeping must do a good job as room was fine - clean, etc. - but it seems like in alexandria va, it would be good to be a dog."
"the monaco is ideally situated only a few minutes walk to the water and among many shops and restaurants. the staff is ever present and helpful. the only downside to it was that the restaurant was short staffed one morning so we decided to go to another nearby spot for breakfast. we later learned from a bartender that one of the wait staff is pregnant and had been sick several times lately. and the bar closes early. there were quite a few people still in it when they made last call around 11 i believe. there is a wine happy hour every day from 5-6 in the lobby. one of the pourers actually remembered what i and my wife drank the night before. finally, i had nearly forgotten this but the elevator doors close very quickly. we missed two because we were slow in getting there. doesn't bother me, but i wonder if some seniors might find it difficult. overall, nice rooms, fantastic location and nice, friendly staff."
only issue was barking dog in room across the hall
the staff was so friendly and i loved the decor and the location. this is a fun and very comfortable place to stay!
awesome! staff is eager to make you comfortable and happy. i won't stay anyplace else when we visit alexandria.
"was attending a conference in downtown dc, and this hotel was in alexandria, a bit far. cabs were readily available, but the cab ride from downtown ate up the difference in rates i would have paid closer to my conference. so a great hotel, with nice details and good service, but for a downtown dc itinerary, a bit remote."
beautiful hotel in a beautiful location. the restaurant was great and staff was friendly
"the beds were very comfortable, the bathroom had plenty of storage area for our things so it didn't get cluttered. the bathrobes were very plush and i loved having the tea and coffee in the lobby to go!"
"good location if you're staying in old town. it was a $15 cab ride to the gaylord convention center and there are plenty of hotels that are an easy walk to the convention center, so i would stay at one of those next time. it was also a $100 cab fare from bwi so be sure to fly into reagan or take the blue super shuttle for $45.the rooms are a bit smallish and if you are sensitive to noisy ac units (why do people always complain about noisy ac?), then this hotel may not be for you."
everyone was so helpful and friendly. jackson 20 is a great bar/restuarant. wish i brought my dog.
beautiful hotel in the heart of historical alexandria 4 blocks from potomac and walking distance to numerous sights and delicious restaurants. staff pleasant and helpful. loved the extras like coffee in am and wine in pm served in vibrant lobby.
a friend and i stayed there just by chance as we were headed through. we were so impressed with the staff and how nice they were and the city of alexandria was absolutely beautiful. this hotel is great and its location is perfect if you are looking for something to do without having to drive.
"prefect location just blocks from the waterfront, shops, restaurants, and pier. the hotel is beautiful and definitely one of my favorites in the kimpton chain. the rooms and lobby have a persian flair. i loved everything about this hotel. the staff was very attentive as well."
"great location. neat lobby, resturant and vibe. decent room at a decent price, especially for the neighborhood."
great service & very affordable price right downtown in alexandria
very comfy with a boutique feel. location was wonderful.
the monaco was clean and cute. easy to get a cab and accommodating staff. room service kept messing up our orders and the night menu is very expensive and limited but overall it was decent. robes are fun but feel like carpet.
my girlfriend and i stayed at the hotel on our way back from myrtle beach back to ny. the hotel was very up to date and plush. the service was amazing also. it is right in the heart of downtown so there is no need for your car once you get there. i would recommend the hotel to anyone.
great property and dog friendly. staff is excellent and very helpful. atmosphere and rooms are top notch high end quality at an affordable price.
"warm and helpful staff; clean, comfortable rooms. afternoon wine reception is very open and well attended - a great time to meet up with friends or make new ones. we borrowed the hotel bicycles to travel to a conference across the potomac - lots of well maintained bike trails in the area. walking distance to anything you'd want to see or do in alexandria."
"our stay was very nice. we just didn't like having to pay for parking at the hotel, so we parked at our son's restaurant. i also didn't like having to pay for wifi!!! it seemed like there were a lot of "" fees & charges""."
new tv did not work properly after technician looked at it numerous times.
"posh hotel right in the heart of the action in alexandria, va! we loved our stay at the monaco on king street, just steps from everything. while we were in town for business, this place made us feel as comfortable as a resort property. evening wine receptions, morning coffee in the cozy but posh lobby appointed like a large living room. business folks, families and dogs all mingling like invited guests at a party. it was wonderful!"
hotel is gorgeous! rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean. staff was very friendly and welcoming. location was excellent. this is the only place i will stay when in alexandria!
"the hotel is simply wonderful. the neighborhood, king street in old town alexandria, va, is fantastic and very convenient to dc. one can walk to shops and dining. plenty of outstanding choices for both. the rooms are great: forward-thinking decor, lots of small details, very clean, very comfortable. complaints: standard definition tv; no fridge or microwave. otherwise, an outstanding experience.and the people are really nice."
this was a delightful hotel stay - we got a real bargain - booked on the morning of our stay at a greatly reduced rate - what a deal!  everything about this hotel was terrific particularly the location - lots of restaurants along with great walkable streets with historic homes and business.  we totally enjoyed this experience.
"my experience at the hotel monaco was just what i expected--clean, professional, courteous. the staff was friendly, the free airport shuttle a plus, and the nightly wine reception delightful."
"we founf the hotel monaco to be a fantastic hotel. the room was very nice and updated, the staff was great."
"old town alexandria is beautiful with several restaurants within walking distance. although i don't know much about this town, it seems as hotel monaco is located right in the middle of every everything. i'm returning to dc in august, and will definitely stay at this hotel (bringing my wife this time)!"
"my experience wasn't great. there was a ton of noise, not only in the room above mine, but in the hall as well. the walls must be paper thin. and the doors of the room have a tendency to be very heavy and slam behind you if you aren't aware... recommendation to hotel: install device to the doors to soften the blow of doors slamming in the hall. i'm trying to sleep!!!"
"beautiful outside, great service from the manager and staff, but the air conditioning didn't work in three rooms that we stayed in. we first arrived to find out that the safe in our room didn't work. then we were switched to another room, whose tv remote didn't work, air conditioning didn't work, and telephone by the bed didn't work. we were switched to another room whose ac didn't work. mind you, we have a siberian husky, so the ac problem was not what we needed. we were upgraded to a two floor suite with two separate thermostats, the bottom stayed cool, but the upstairs was still unbearable. overall, the manager tried to appease us with the room upgrade, and even paid for our dinner one night and parking for three nights. but sleeping in 74 degree plus temps is not my idea of a comfortable vacation, regardless of the accomodations or benefits."
"this is a unique hotel with steady guest traffic. dogs are allowed and they are everywhere, so if you are a dog lover, this is the place to be. my room overlooked king street but was still quiet and very comfortable. a fun place to stay!the hotel is a convenient walk to the potomac and harbours as well as many great restaurants."
"everything was fantastic: location, door staff, etc. the only down note was at check-out there were some extra charges. we brought it to staff attention. she took some charges off, then we showed again where it was wrong. we were not upset at the charges as mistakes are made everywhere, but her attitude about it was very non-caring. i repeat, this waqs the only down note and i still recommend the hotel. i believe the staff anme was jackie."
"my stay was wonderful! i would recommend this hotel highly. from the valet parking attendant to the rest of the staff, everyone was wonderful. the rooms were immaculate and there are plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. the metro statio is about 10 blocks from the hotel but t he free trolley makes it a breeze to get thrs. i wish my stay was longer and i will definitely stay at the monaco again!"
"got there a little late as the wine tasting was over. we had been trying to wait as a violent storm pushed ahead of us. we were successful, but it put us checking into the hotel after 10:00 at night. by the time we got everything unpacked and settled into the beautiful and well-appointed room, only a few items were still being delivered 24/7 by rooms service. the food and its service was my only disappointment.the brocolli cheese soap was cold when we got it, but the hummus was well-warmed to a degree that would have better suited the soup.my mother didn't received any napkins or utensils, so i shared my knife with her for the hummus/pitas.i ended up pulling out some travel napkins from my bag. i wish there had been a coffee maker in the room, but we ordered a carafe of it for breakfast.so those were the annoyances, but the room was so gorgeous felt roomy and was so well-appointed and comfortable. the linens and pillows were top of the line and it felt as though we were in capable and caring hands.i look forward staying here again."
"the hotel is very convenient in its location to all the stuff in old town. the staff was courteous and professional. the decor is something of an aquired taste. the room was large and clean and a good price. however my ""courtyard view"" was little more than a view of the hotel's trash dumpster.  the situation with room service is sub par. it's a long story. over all the hotel is a good place to stay given how centrally located it is in old town. just don't expect too much from the room service."
"wonderful place to stay for both alexandria and dc visit. staff was very courteous, freindly, and responsive to requests. rooms and public areas were very nice. little details -- like chilled drinks in the lobby and option to have a gold fish in your room -- make this hotel feel like a home away from home."
"lovely hotel. comfortable and spacious room, amazingly quiet with excellent blackout draperies which enabled us to sleep soundly. the staff was very pleasant and efficient. when we had problems with the tv remote, an engineer was sent promptly to our room to take care of it. wish we could have stayed another night or two! convenient inside parking was a plus."
"this boutique hotel was fantastic! the staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful. we loved how pet friendly this hotel is, and how clean it is. we were in the heart of king street and were very close to everything. i would highly recommend this hotel and i will be staying here again!"
i only spent on night here on business but would return for business or pleasure trips.
"wonderful hotel, with great customer service. i have stayed at autograph hotels before and this definitely lives up to their prestige."
gorgeous hotel. perfect for our honeymoon. the staff was helpful and courteous. the room was clean and well stocked. we had a fabulous time there.
a very very pleasant experience-and at a reasonable price.
it's a very nice hotel with a fine bar & restaurant attached. it's only 2 blocks from the heart of the fun nightlife and several good restaurants of old town alexandria. the hotel is what you would expect from kimpton.
not sure why this is called a 5 star hotel.  nothing 5 star about it.  was very disappointed with the hotel..
just back after four nights at the hotel monaco alexandria. great location. easy walk to the metro. we were surprised how nice the hotel was. very clean. excellent service. the 5-6 pm wine reception each night was great. we were somewhat concerned about the fact that the hotel welcomes pets - but our room was perfectly clean and the furniture in good condition. alexandria is a super location to stay while visiting the washington area. short metro ride to downtown washington. lots of restaurants on king street. the shopping was good as well. we are planning to return next year at the same time.
"hotel monaco has an excellent location, nice modern rooms with comfortable bed and linens. we decided to move rooms when we realized a wedding reception had adjourned to the room next to ours and received excellent service in helping us make the room switch."
"we really enjoy the entire kimpton hotel group. the monaco in alexandria is a gem! the location on king street is in the middle of all the restaurants and walking distance to the water front. we stayed for new year's eve for alexandria's first night firework celebration and would do it again :). the staff is very friendly, the lobby is set up like you are in a comfy living room with of course, the traditional wine hour. the gym is fine but there is a great running / walking route along the water."
the front desk staff went the extra step to ensure our meeting ran smoothly - happy clients - thank you!
the team at the hotel took care of us like they had known us for years.  the customer service could not had been better.  a very pet friendly hotel.  morning coffee and afternoon wine in the lobby was nice each day.  i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the alexandria area.
fantastic location. wonderful service and ambiance.
"it was the luck of the draw that i picked the monaco in downtown alexandria. dc has always been a difficult, if not frightening experience for me. then along came kimpton's hotel monaco alexandria. our room was a single king. it came with a large flat panel tv, pre-filled goody shelf and fridge, free wifi, nice lounge and plenty of room. the decorating was tasteful, well done, and quite comfortable. the most exceptional part of the hotel, however, was the staff. it was obvious that they had been well trained from house keeping to management. all were polite, helpful and made us feel welcome and at home. the location is incredible. it is located on king st about 4 blocks up from the river and one more block from the ferry stop. king st is the main artery that runs through the heart of old town alexandria. the setting is beautiful and relatively quiet. there are shops and restaurants up and down both sides of the street for blocks. history abounds here so there is plenty to do just in the local area without going into dc. if you want to do the dc thing, there is a free trolley which runs every 15 min from 10am to 10pm the length of king st (20 blocks) to drop you off at the metro station. you can pick up the blue line there which will take you to about any site you want to see or get to including national airport. old alexandria is a very comfortable place to be. i felt at ease walking along king st any time of the day or night."
"great place awesome view from terrace. room was great, just wish they would give you free wifi and a microwave...kinda a no brainer for the price."
"need exhaust fans in restrooms, coffee maker and coffee. great lobby and great service"
"apart from the usual issues, as addressed in the numerical ratings above: the hotel staff here are some of the friendliest i have ever seen anywhere."
great walking access to lots of dining and shopping. love the restaurant attached
"we had to return the room key 4 times in 3 days, it stopped working. otherwise i would recommend the hotel it was great, close to stores, restaurants and transportation. they are pet friendly and there was a good mix of people, i heard several languages spoken in the lobby."
excellent staff; courteous and extremely helpful. perfect location. nice touch with happy hour and free coffee for the guests. the attached restaurant is very good. the room was very clean and the bed was comfortable and good pillows!
"great location very nice hotel we booked a delux king and it was big and comfortable the decor is very nice vvery nice staff ,we will retrun"
"the hotels.com post - and my confirmation email - said ""free wifi"". this was the deciding factor over a nearby hotel that appeared cheaper but charged $15 a day for wifi. turns out wifi is free only for kimpton rewards members. and they mean it, and they stood by it when i checked out. only the hotels.com confirmation email, with the words ""free wifi"" in it, and my threat to write to hotels about it, changed their minds. anyway, beware. all that said... i love this hotel. amazing neighborhood, great hotel restaurant and bar, and it's pretty reasonable for what you get."
"top notch, enjoyable experience. perfect place for a old towne visit."
flew in for an early morning meeting in dc. only stayed one night. it was lovely and i enjoyed the happy hour!
"we checked in to escape a snowstorm. noticing my very pregnant wife, they upgraded our room. they allowed us to extend our reservation as necessary during the storm. a great hotel made better by caring service."
great place to stay but be prepared for a $27./ day parking fee!
our stay was wonderful with the only exception being the lack of in-room coffee--a tiny factor overall. we met some fabulous canine guests!
"this hotel was luxuriously appointed, quiet, and had lots of nice amenities (such as the free wine hour, even though i wasn't there to partake in it, and the offer to print boarding passes for you). however, i was disappointed by some very small touches that the hotel didn't provide, such as no shuttle transportation to the nearby (but not near enough) metro station and nowhere to park briefly (without cost) while one checks in. still, i had a nice stay, and the neighborhood offers lots of interesting things to do and eat."
the location in old towne was very convenient and the service and comfort of the hotel was great. i would definitely go back.
"location - perfect! amenities - outstanding! atmosphere - fabulous! this hotel is just terrific... we stayed in several hotels on our extended vacation and by far, this was the most comfortable from the bed to the air temp controls to the bath amenities. the service was fantastic. there was a great young woman at the front desk who was supremely helpful. the only odd thing is the coffee in the lobby is not available until 7am... 6am would have been nice. other than that, this is a wonderful hotel."
this was a beautiful hotel. loved that it was so dog friendly (even though my pet was not with me).
"excellent hotel in excellent location; great style and design, very comfortable, pet friendly too. only complains would be the music from their inner courtyard that kicks in at 5am (is that really necessary?) and the $50 resort fee, which is just a way to post a more competitive price online. for business this fee can be problematic as it is a separate charge, like the minibar, for which i will not be reimbursed. also, parking right across the street is much cheaper! otherwise 5 star all the way"
"beautiful hotel with excellent service that is welcoming and friendly, not judgmental and snooty. those deep tubs are worth every penny. i only wish that there wasn't so much clutter about the room in the form of brochures and promotional cards, etc. these seem to be new, as the kimpton hotels company is growing. this was my second time at the hotel, and i enrolled in the hotel's parent company loyalty program for free because i have been so pleased with the service at hotel monaco alexandria."
"the hotel staff could not be more helpful. eventhough we were originally given a queen room instead of a king, the staff quickly rectified the situation and we loved our stay. the hotel is located right in the heart of old town which made it so easy to walk to all the shopping and restaurants. very clean!"
"perfectly located in old town on king street. the staff was friendly and helpful. the room was spacious, well-decorated and well-appointed (with a whimsical touch). the bathrobes were cheetah and zebra printed terry cloth, for example... it was great. very convenient to reagan national airport and washington, dc, too. we rode bikes to mt. vernon on the gw parkway bike path which was walking distance from hotel monaco. all in all, pretty much perfect."
"location was perfect for my purpose. staff helpful, room comfortable and clean. even got a daily ny times! would stay there again."
"great location! fun area for shopping, dining and a quick trip to d.c."
"location, history and wonderful services. the hotel provides a ""goldfish"" on request from the front desk!!!great gym and pool on the 3rd floor.walk to all of the best restaurants and sights in ""old town"""
"ok, i like dogs, but this is crazy. there were dogs everywhere, the patio, the lobby, at check in and check out. not just a few, there were lots of dogs.the lobby was quite small and was always very busy, the hotel staff were awful. the room however, was clean, nicely done and very pleasant."
my overall experience was great. i loved the quirky decor. the 5pm wine reception was a nice touch. it was my birthday and they sent me a complimentary bottle of champagne and truffles. the room was very clean and the bed super comfortable. great hotel
"this hotel is amazing! right in the middle of pedestrian friendly old town. the staff is great and the hotel is extremely clean. a bit pricey, but that is the only downside....but then again...you get what you pay for."
"went there to old town for quick weekend. great place, great location in old town. the other hotels are more toward upper end by metro (a mile)this hotel in perfect spot. if you want metro there is a free shuttle every 15 minutes up and down king street. get you there no problem. what a neat place the whole area full of food, irish bars,great shopping. i would definitely come back to this hotel. i had a suite and it had a balcony( not much view but ok if you smoke or just enjoy)"
"very nice, good rate, great location. ac unit was noisy but otw good experience."
"we looked for a hotel in the heart of old town alexandria within walking distance of carlyle house. this was it! from hotel monaco airport pick up on, we were treated very well. love the lobby, great sofas, chairs, well placed tables with access to coffee and other drinks in the morning, candy stand and games in the afternoon, followed by wine and appetizers in the evening (for about 2 hours per event each day). in the room, we requested a rollaway bed. the bathroom was supplied with full size shampoo, conditioner and bathing gel. the closet was small, however, as we were only staying 2 nights, it was adequate for our needs. questions asked were researched, if needed. answers were complete."
great hotel in prime location. plenty to do in old town alexandria. close to transport for easy access to arlington or washington. rooms very clean and comfortable. air conditioner a bit noisy but this seems to be common in the older buildings that have been renovated.
"this hotel was a pleasant surprise. the location was great and the interior design was fun and comfortable. the service was great at both the front desk and when i needed something. the only complaint i have is the cost of room service. if you order a meal in to your room, they essentially charge you two fees. one of which i hadn't noticed before i ordered. other than that, it was a great place to stay."
"the room and service where great. during the night, the ac made terrible vibrating noises. did not sleep very well. did not want to call the front desk at that time of night, also did not want to have to get dressed in the middle of the night."
"prior to arriving at the hotel monaco, i tried to change some elements of the reservation -- and we had made reservations for two rooms for multiple days. it took me more than an hour to get to the right person.upon our arrival, we checked in as usual -- it's been a good choice in the past. but on the first morning, we were informed that "" 'the' coffee pot was inoperative,"" so that we would not have the promised coffee amenities. i was told that i could wait until a local starbucks opened and purchase coffee there. hmmmm??? or, could hotel monaco have obtained coffee from a local vendor to meet their promise to customers? a ""broken"" coffee pot was not my problem -- but theirs.we travel to alexandria every two months or so, and we're re-thinking our next stay, despite the hotel monaco's desirable location."
"front desk had no idea what they were doing, took 3 people just to check me in, and they were giving each other dirty looks because they kept stepping over each other.room decor was mismatched and random.over priced for nothing.. 3rd time i have stayed at kimpton properties, won't do a 4th."
we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel monaco. we plan to stay there every time we're in alexandria.
"i usually enjoy kimpton hotels, and the monaco has great potential, however it is also a favorite spot for weddings, and apparently they are not staffed well enough to keep things under control, leaving non-wedding guests suffering. there were children lacking appropriate adult suervision galloping up and down my hall, dogs left alone in rooms and barking incessantly, and all the manager could tell me was they would send someone up to check, the dogs' owners' had been called...blah blah blah. by 10 pm i had given up and tried to find another local room but none could be found for me. the manager assured me the wedding was over at 11, however that just happened to be when the die-hards moved the party to the courtyard; drunken guests whooping it up and taking flash photos. i had had a rough couple of days and just desperately wanted to go to sleep early that night; i finally passed out at 1 am. my night was comped when i spoke to the day manager in the morning, but the damage was done. the wedding party was obviously the priority to the night manager, who completely failed the rest of the guests in his charge. i may give the place another chance, during the week, but probably not."
"friendly, helpful staff....great, comfortable room."
"very clean and nice hotel in the heart of historic alexandria. the customer service was excellent, we asked for a crib for the baby and they brought it right up, within minutes. very attentive!"
this is the second thanksgiving in a row that my family has stayed at the hotel monaco. great location and great services! thank you!
"old town is an awesome place to visits. very historic! quiet, and clean."
this was a great place to stay and in a great location. the staff was helpful and pleasant. we would be hard-pressed to complain.
the location is very close to old town alexandria and the price was nice.
"my wife and i took a trip out to d.c. and stayed at the kimpton hotel in alexandria.  although the walk to the metro is about 20 min, the nightlife in alexandria was more than exciting.  we wanted a nice restaurant to eat at for our anniversary and the desk attendents took care of everything for us.  they set up reservations for us at the chart house on the potomac river and ordered us a desert on them.  we also had menus printed out with our name on top saying congratulations.  the staff was incredible and we would stay at any kimpton hotel again if the experience was like the one we had."
the hotel was great. the rooms are very large and the staff is fantastic.
"thoroughly enjoyed it. it was my birthday and i came back to my room to a cupcake and bottle of wine. a nice touch! room was spacious and the bed was huge and comfortable. ordered room service and dinner (bbq salmon, mac n cheese, and collard greens) was better than expected."
overall outstanding stay! staff was friendly and helpful. nice tea and coffee bar set up in the morning. would most definitley stay here again when i am in alexandria.
we were extremely pleased with the personal and truly caring attitudes of the staff and the value of the stay.  the valet parking kept our truck safe and was very convenient...the only downside of the stay was minor-the handicapped bathroom was impossible to keep dry.  the water ran out of the shower enclosure and soaked the entire floor.  we will stay here again for sure!!!
the hotel is great but the restaurant leaves a bit to be desired.
to our surprise at check in we were upgraded to a suite!   hotel itself is beautiful!
our hotel stay was fabulous. the staff was terrific. they even sent my husband and i an anniversary card and a complimentary gift in honor of our anniversary. this is a four star hotel that treated us like 5 star quests.
excellent staff - helpful and professional. a pleasure to stay at this hotel and probably the best experience i've had in usa
dogs in lobby and dry rotted tearing linen on bed.
"we took the metro to washington dc almost every day to take in the sites.  we spent our down time wandering around ""old town"" and had a great time.  we took the ferry to mt vernon for a day.  i have never seen so much red brick or green countryside in any one place before being from fresno, california.  the hotel staff was very, very helpful everyday during our stay."
"very lovely hotel. great service. comfortable bed. big room. however, too far from the metro station and the free shuttle doesn't begin service until 11:30. the restaurant next door not worth going to."
"i absolutely loved everything about this hotel. it was totally unique and definitely my style. i visited with 2 dogs, and the staff were so helpful and even remembered my name every time i came in and out. the lobby, elevators, hallways, everything is all gorgeous. really great designer. check in/out was easy. only problem i have with this hotel is that they charged me 164$ when i left. i haven't called yet to ask what this was for. i did park overnight for one night and i did use the internet for one day, but that doesn't seem to add up to almost 200$. that's the only reason i didn't rate 5 stars."
"what a treat. from the welcoming, bright and comfortable lobby to the exceptionally friendly valet and concierge staff - we enjoyed every minute. breakfast at the restaurant was delicious and the service prompt. the location is perfect. we loved this hotel and will definitely return when possible."
cool location. clean hotel room with great character.
"this hotel is nothing short is amazing! it is beautiful, clean, perfectly located, and clean! the list could go on and on.the only minor complaint i have is that the bed could be a little less hard"
i have stayed at kimpton hotels often and this is the only one that did not make the grade.   many other alexandria hotels are by far superior!  this property is a former holiday inn and it still unfortunately felt like it.  i will stay at other hotels when i get back to alexandria and will not consider this one.  this is so far below the standards of the dupont circle palomar that i was shocked.  unfortunately this will probably lead me to not consider other kimpton hotels i have not seen before i stay at them.  the hotel was way way overpriced for what it is.  the chain needs to fix this one because it brings down the entire kimpton reputation. they have a great king street location but that is all.  the hotel did not even offer free newspapers--inexcusable for the price.  i left after one night and  spent the next four nights in a nearby hotel that was everything this one was not--and i paid $100 a night less.  this is a very poor excuse for a boutique hotel.
"set in beautiful old town, the setting for this hotel is quite calming and as a dog-friendly establishment, bringing fido was another plus... however, all the outdoor beauty and stylish hotel esthetics cannot mask how awful our customer service/staff experience was. from requesting room service, or inquiring about an ac issue, nothing was timely. most of the time we had to call back after 30 minutes to ask for service again otherwise it wouldn't have come!"
"the monaco alexandria is a recently remodeled hotel in the heart of downtown alexandria, va.our room was well styled, very clean and much nicer than rooms we have paid much more for in the past. we did not use its restaurant.there were simultaneus wedding receptions going on so the atmosphere was both busy and festive. we parked in a garage only a block away for $12 for one night. doorman, room service and check in agents were all nice and professional.the 3pm check in time was not altered due to our early arrival but we did not mind the 30 minute wait. there were free refreshments in the lobby."
very nice hotel. i was able to have a goldfish brought up to the room (just for the fun of it). we had our old dog with us and it was hard to find grass for him to use the bathroom.
"great location, very friendly staff, clean, courteous, professional and comfortable. well appointed. would definitely stay there again."
great hotel...already referred it to friends...planning a second visit...staff was great!
"very funky little hotel... the only thing(s) i'd change would be to have a small coffee maker in the room and maybe a complimentary bottle of water because the tap water tastes terrible and there is no mini-bar. otherwise great, we plan on returning very soon."
"for those not taking pets along with you on the road, this hotel is probably more of a 4 than a 3.we never got the advertised amenities for our dog even though we clearly checked in with her when we arrived at the hotel. complimentary dog bags were provided (only when we asked for them), but nowhere near the level of service advertised for our four-legged companion.the internet at the hotel is not complimentary. they make you sign up for their rewards program to have access to the internet at their hotel. (a minor pain admittedly, but when one is in a hurry, it's a completely unnecessary hassle)."
"although a ways from dc, this hotel's value can't be beat. beautiful design, spacious rooms and excellent ammenities. plus old town is charming in it's own right, not to mention the good food & coffee within the hotel and nearby."
"great location, you can walk to the metro and any kind of food you want.  very comforable hotel with a very professional staff.  you won't go wrong with staying here."
second time staying here -- one of the most dog friendly cities and this hotel loves dogs!! my pet felt happy and welcome. room clean comfy :) staff friendly extended my checkout time upon special request. overall great experience and yes will stay again !
"i visit the hotel monaco alexandria every spring and am always impressed! great service, great location, great hotel!"
the hotel was beautiful. rooms were well kept and staff was a delight.
we loved the hotel and the staff was great but where our room was located it was extremely noisy. there was a staff entrance near our door on the 2nd floor and i think that was the source.
"we stayed at this hotel for our visit to dc. it was perfect because it was a short drive to dc. restaurants, shopping, blues bar all in walking distance."
best hotel in old town alexandria! quality is consistent across the country too.
hotel was pretty on the surface. mattress was not luxury. ac was so loud had to literally turn it off. walls paper thin and doors need to be cushioned so they don't slam.
"staff was top notch. it's expensive, but then again the whole town is so you should already be aware of that.great if you have pets. my kids spent their time in the pool which has a lifeguard on duty a nice feature if you are looking after more then one kid."
service was great but they seem to be skimpy with the shampoo and towels.
"comfortable hotel. very clean and quiet. it's older, but kept up very well. only down side is workout room is small and heat was set at 72 which was too warm. my room was near a storage room and people in there were very load at 5:30am and woke me up. there must have been shelves against the wall of my bed and they were so loud and aggressive that my bed was shaking."
loved the location and service. very pet friendly. excellent restaurant. nice happy hour! many great restaurants and fast walk to the river walkway. easy access to free trolley and metro.
excellent. rooms are very spacious and clean. overall high quality hotel.
the hotel is in the heart of old towne alexandria which made it very easy to walk to the different shops and historical sites in the area-not needing a rental car or having to pay for parking. uber was accessed a couple of times when going to dc and mount vernon. this is our 2nd time to stay at hotel monaco over the thanksgiving day weekend.
we stayed here to attend a convention in the national harbour. our room was a little dusty in a few spots but otherwise everything appeared clean. the people at the front desk were especially polite and courteous. if we stay in the area again this will likely be our first choice.
"a great old hotel in an historic location, convenient for shopping, dinning, and historic site visits. we were very impressed by the door staff, bellmen and desk staff. we were less impressed by the limited storage in our room (we stayed for a week), the lack of towel bars in the bath, and the chilly temps in the bathroom. otherwise, the room was wonderful. we would be happy to stay there again in the future.i hate the trend toward duvets in place of blankets. it is nearly impossible to make the room cool enough at night to make the duvet usable. without it's cover, of course, the sleeper is too cold to be comfortable. hence, a night in bed is a constant process of pushing down and pulling up the duvet.the wine reception each afternoon is a very nice touch."
the hotel is beautifully furnished. i was particularly impressed with the hotel having a humidifer and accessories like this available to us. i would definitely recommend a stay here.
"we booked this hotel through expedia's unpublished rates section, so we thought it might be a bit of a gamble... well, the gamble paid off. this hotel is simply delightful. the unique decor sets it apart from other cookie cutter hotels, and our room was spacious and comfortable. the best feature is its proximity to the high street shopping district with tons of restaurants. it is also only a few blocks from the waterfront. during our stay we enjoyed some lovely walks though old town and along the patomac and we never needed to get our car from the garage! i would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a place in alexandria."
"the hotel monaco alexandria - a kimpton hotel, alexandria, virginia was such a lovely place to stay!! this hotel was in a great location, it was very clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful. i plan on going again!!!"
"we stayed in a king deluxe room. the location is perfect. many restaurants and bars within walking distance. 15-20 minute drive to dc. hotel rooms are very clean and one of the biggest rooms i've stayed in. bed was very comfortable. large marble bathroom. the heated indoor swimming pool on the third floor was a major plus. definitely check it out if you are bored of the ""classic"" hotel look."
"we loved the hotel monaco! great location, clean, very comfy room and the employees we dealt with were all extremely friendly. would definitely stay here again!"
"lovely, charming place.  good location.  worst bed i've ever slept on.  the mattress was about 12"" deep on one side, 3"" on the other.  if you get that room, insist they move you!"
"this is a fun boutique hotel with lots of little extra touches that make it above average and the location is fantastic. service was really great, everyone was very friendly and helpful. a word of caution: if you don't like dogs, don't stay here. the hotel is very dog friendly - and although it is very clean, there is only so much they can do to cover up some of the dog scents."
chic and comfortable hotel that is right in the heart of old town. excellent customer service. rooms are a bit small but the decor is modern.
"this is a pleasant boutique hotel within walking distance to the waterfront. i found it to be quiet, clean, and comfortable. i would go back."
"this was a great experience in particular due to the colorful decor, availability of bicycles and pet policy. now i look for a kimpton or monaco hotel when traveling!"
"great atmosphere, close to everything in old town. hip decor, big room and bathroom."
"washington, dc's hidden gem in the historic district of old town alexandria. professional and friendly staff with excellent amenities. has its own professional historian on site. whimsical design and caters to pet owners whom have had to leave their pets home by providing a pet fish for your stay. excellent restaurant on site and fast and wonderful room service. in-room spa services available."
"my family came to the dc area to attend the monday night football game between the redskins and the browns... my daughter was cheerleading at the game and my fianc�� and her son had never been to dc before. this was my first time staying at the monaco and i was very impressed from the moment i arrived and walked through the doors, the staff was very friendly and helpful, there is a trolley to and from the metro station and the blue line that runs directly to the arlington cemetery, washington mall, and all the way to fedex field for the game.... in our 5 day stay we enjoyed the nightly wine tasting and the assistance from the staff with a few business issues i had to deal with olina at the front desk is fantastic she is smart, efficient and handles business with a level of professionalism that you don't usually see in a young lady these days. all in all i will be a regular with hotel monaco from this point forward. thank you all we will be back!"
"it was written in a review recently that there was a definite odor to the hotel...i can't speak for anyone else, but i found no odors what so ever and i consider my smell sensitive.the room was beautiful, clean, neat and very comfortable and the staff was great. i had a queen bed with a balcony...very nice. no coffee/tea in the room but there is a fridge with asst refreshments to purchase and coffee/tea down stairs in the am. the hotel is centrally located in an adorably quaint town close to dc. there is a free trolly riding up and down king st every 15-20 min stopping on every 2 blocks for your convience. they are all brick sidewalks so wear walking shoes, not heels....i recommend and would go back"
"excellent accomodations. i needed to ""trust"" that expedia would get me a four-star room for the right price...and they did! thanks."
"i love kimpton's idea of what a hotel should be. none of them are stuffy. this is the 6th kimpton hotel we've stayed at and probably our favorite. for a romantic get-away it can't be beat. relaxed, attentive service set a great tone for the weekend. for a business trip, the service is professional and efficient and give me what i need to relax in a hotel. hotel monaco in old town alexandria executed perfectly on all levels to make our stay really nice."
we were very pleased with the accommodations and decor.  although there were dogs at the property we were not bothered by them at all.  we requested a room on a pet free floor. cheap parking is available at the courthouse parking lot across from the hotel. we paid $10 for 2 days at the lot. great deal!
i was very satisfied and happy with this hotel.  sleeping room and bathroom were clean and spacious.  wine party and tea and coffee in the lobby were nice touches.
"great hotel and great place to stay except for the fact that they put us in a room surrounded by guests with dogs, which woke us up throughout the night and early in the morning."
"we enjoyed staying here for a planned 3 night trip. we were so satisfied with our stay that when our vacation plans changed, partly due to airline cancellation, we booked two more nights at the monaco. highly recommend a stay here."
awesome hotel! i will come back and stay here again!
classy hotel with so much to do. all with in walking distance.
great mid town location and close to all the sights.
we had a wonderful time. i loved the location and the room. the dinner at the restaurant was delicious. i would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again.
first time to washington dc. everyone very helpful and friendly
"i've stayed at hotel monaco before, and it was great. this time it was a little less great, but still good. got stuck in the farthest room (didn't even know these rooms existed) from the elevator in a mid-week stay. i could have taken all of my luggage back downstairs and requested another room, i guess, but i was tired. annoying that there are no coffee makers in the rooms. carpeting is looking pretty worn. but--nice bed, great location, and generally very friendly and helpful staff."
cute hotel in convenient location. trolley stop across the street from hotel. only negative thing about this hotel is they allow dogs ... dogs bark early in the morning
hotel is in perfect location close to restaurants and shopping
"i was in town for a funeral and stayed one night only. however, it was a pleasant experience from the minute i stepped into the hotel. staff (from the complimentary airport pick up/drop off, doorman, front desk, etc.) are friendly and professional. they also print out my departure boarding pass for the following day at no charge. (you can request a form to fill out at the front desk). the room decor has a unique historic setting yet modern color pattern which give a fresh and luxury look. it's also clean with big mirrors, sufficient lighting and space to feel relax and comfortable. one down side of the room is air conditioner is loud if it's on at night. one small part occur during my stay make this hotel stand out from the others. after the funeral i return to the hotel for a quick change, i was handed with a cool hand towel at the lobby. it was certainly a surprise yet appreciated during that hot afternoon. they also have ice tea available at the lobby and ice popsicle for the kids too. (during certain hour though). nice lobby and courtyard to hang out and chat with friends. i will definitely come back and bring the family for a longer stay and explore old town alexandria and nearby washington dc. in the near future."
"hotel has a great location on king street. great food and drink options near by, and nice hotel bar. good service overall. easy to access from reagan airport by taxi, metro and free king street trolley, or uber."
the monaco is right in the middle of old town within walking distance of everything cool that you'd want to see or try. they do charge for parking and internet but worth it
this is my favorite place to stay. the people working there all make me feel like a billion bucks!
"staff was unbelievable and wanted to make sure your every need was met. they knew our names by the time we checked out of the hotel. the location in old town alexandria was wonderful. it is within walking distance to shopping and dining, and there was a free trolley to transport you to the metro line which was then only 20-30 minute commute to dc. the rooms were spacious, and the onsite dining was great. my husband and i enjoyed the complimentary wine and appetizers each evening, and my daughter loved attending the ""doggy happy hours."" this was our first time at a kimpton hotel, but it definitely will not be our last."
"this must be a well known dog hotel. unfortunately, i was one of the few who didn't know that in advance. there were many, many yappy dogs early in the morning and late at night. great if you have a dog, but not so great if you weren't planning on a bark fest.also, the room service continental breakfast was pretty sad ... cold coffee and old pastries. we should have wandered to the amazing farmer's market which runs every saturday morning across the street at city hall.and finally, there was no hot water for a few hours in the morning.i've stayed at the morrison house (a sister property a few blocks away) and found it a notch above in all respects. it was booked on this night or i would have stayed there."
"the hotel had a really nice vibe to it. pets are allowed are certain floors and, even though i didn't have a pet, i thought it was fun to have them around and welcomed. they weren't a problem at all.location is fantastic. great for walking around, seeing the old town area, and doing a little window shopping.i also liked the manager's reception each night. it was great to mingle with the other guests while sipping on a complimentary glass of wine. all in all, a very good experience. would definitely go back."
"overall the hotel was a bust, from a surprise parking fee, to a dirty shower, to the homeless folk, sleeping in the doorway outside. i was very much unimpressed. the super uncomfortable mattress was just icing on the cake."
"we were concerned about the cost of parking in old town alexandria, but the hotel bellman mentioned that the visitors center provided free parking passes."
"charming, unique hotel. appreciated the wine in the lobby . very helpful staff"
"i have stayed here a few times because i love everything about it. cleanliness, friendly, gorgeous and wonderful location of king street. after staying at several of the hotels on king street for comparison, i am happy to say this one is my favorite."
"great service, cozy, clean & in the heart of everything - great location!"
"nice hotel with interesting interior, roomy pool. our room was small but very neat."
"the hotel monaco was an excellent choice in a superb location. originally booked our mini vacation for 2 days and extended a day longer. we didn't want to leave!!! the hotel is located right in the middle of old town and everything was within walking distance from the hotel. we were also traveling with 2 dogs and had no problems with them during our stay. my only complaint is the lack of grass for the babies to go do their ""business"" in around the hotel. we had to walk a couple blocks up to this one strip of grass for bathroom breaks. there are parks down by the water, but for late nite runs it would've been nice if we could have taken them to the courtyard for a quickie. maybe they can invest in remodeling it in the future to accommodate their pet friendly status. overall, it was an excellent stay with beautiful rooms and a very curtious and helpful staff. highly recommended!"
i stay at dozens of upscale hotels every year. this hotel is being renovated and ought to be closed until those renovations are complete. i can not exaggerate how lousy my stay was.
"the location is perfect (in the old town, a few blocks from the water), the staff is wonderful, and the room was excellent (large, comfortable, well appointed and clean). moreover, it was much cheaper than other hotels in the area. i will certainly return to this hotel, if i'm in the area again."
our stay was delightful. while the hotel is clean and nicely appointed...don't miss the wine reception! the lobby furniture could use a bit of freshening. overall...highly recommend!
"an enjoyable location, a long walk from where i was doing business but worth it for the after hours ambiance of king street by the river."
"i really enjoyed the location, it was so close to the main street that runs through old town alexandria. you could walk right out of the hotel and up and down king st to many stores, restaurants, bars, and the water. there was also a fresh farmers market in the town square literally steps from the hotel. i really enjoyed all the fresh produce and baked goods for sale there. the only thing i was unhappy with at the hotel was the parking garage. it is so small and it was packed when we checked in. once we finally found a spot we chose to not even drive our vehicle as to not have to encounter that stressful dilemma again! another issue was that the room did not have a microwave. if one stays several nights and has left overs from a restaurant you can not re-heat anything in your room. plus the room comes with a refrigerator but they pack it with their items they want you to purchase so that was also a hassle i just took theirs own and put mine in until i was about to leave and then restocked it with their items. other than that i thought the hotel was nice and very conveniently located."
enjoyed the monaco again. we have stayed there several times in the past. the staff is friendly and informative as well as helpful.we did request a queen bed but since we arrived late in the evening only rooms with 2 double beds were available. not a big deal but would have liked a room with a queen size bed.
nice hotel within walking distance of the metro and lots of great tourists sites.  beautiful neighborhood.  friendly staff.  would definitely stay there on my next trip to alexandria.
the hotel was beautiful with great amenities. several (not all) of the staff were not very friendly or accommodating. snobbish and rude.
extremely clean rooms and great service. only complaint is the pool operation hours.
"it's a good place. it is very obviously pet friendly, a lot of dogs. the hotel was clean. the staff at the hotel were friendly, helpful and professional. as opposed to the staff at the adjoining restaurant, jackson 20. those folks were immature, inattentive and unprofessional. too bad, because the food is decent. they could benefit from some front of the house training.overall, though ,we had a good experience at this hotel."
we were initially given an accessible room upon arrival. the room was fine except for the handicap shower which flooded the bathroom floor when my wife showered. i notified the front desk of the issue and they sent an employee to check the problem. the desk then called back and gave us another room without hesitation which we grateful for since their were a couple of weddings at the hotel that weekend. overall very happy with the experience.
"it's always a pleasure to stay at the monaco in alexandria. the room wa great, staff is very nice and the neighborhood is also great."
"very friendly staff, location to free trolley on king street helped to get to the metro for trip to dc. price for parking should be included in hotel cost. nice breakfast foods. our room had a nice view of the court yard, but my brother's roomlooked into a trashy alley."
fantastic hotel with all anyone could ask for in downtown alexandria!!
"this is a fine enough place to stay. the hotel could use a little modernization, but it would not keep me from going back if i needed to be in alexandria for business"
"the hotel was located in a convenient area for old town area of alexandria. it has been updated beautifully and was extremely dog friendly. i was most impressed by the staff, which was welcoming and attentive in every way. a welcome respite after a long drive!"
"we loved the location of the hotel and the staff were very friendly...what i did not like about the room was that when we first walked in it smelled musty (but they did fix it after i told them about it), one of the windows was stuck so i can only open one (very noisy from the road), and the vent in the bathroom was not working (which made the bathroom and the room hot after taking showers).......other than that the room was comfortable....honestly, i did expect a little better for $500.00/two nights"
"nice hotel in a nice location. very attentive staff. lovely lobby with great decor. morning coffee in lobby was terrible and weak. the staff provided an in room coffee maker free of charge when we asked for one. there was a wedding group at the hotel which was incredibly noisy on both thursday and friday night--shouting in the hall ways at 1 am, 2am and 4 am...a bit annoying that the staff couldn't control the noise."
"best location and lovely area, safe and friendly. great. shopping and things to see."
"great facilities (including outstanding on-site restaurant - best breakfast in old town), excellent service and exceedingly comfortable room added up to a superior travel experience. we look forward to returning soon."
if you are staying in old town and are not afraid to spend a little money then this is the hotel for you. the monaco is located almost smack dab in the middle of old town. it is a great location for walking down to the river or for heading towards the metrorail. it is right on king street so eateries and shops greet you almost immediately as you walk out the front doors.
"this was a phenominal stay for my girlfriend and me. the hotel was in great condition, the staff was very friendly. i ended up getting very sick while i was there, and the hotel did everything they could to make my stay as painless as possible. i would highly recommend this hotel to folks visiting old town, and we will absolutely stay here again. thanks to the hotel for a great experience!"
"it was a pleasant experience, the wait staff was quite helpful throughout the night. the room was immaculate and well stocked with all types of extras that might have been forgotten. i would highly recommend it and would stay there again"
this hotel is great. it has a comfy room that is well decorated. the location in old town alexandria is convenient to walk to shopping and food.
this is an annual october reunion in alexandria. on prior visits we have stayed at large hotels on other end of king street near the masonic temple. we will opt for monaco or lorien on all future trips. very guest friendly.
a wonderful experience. no not miss this one! it is located in a part of alexandria that has everything at your doorstep. resturants so diverse that you will be sorry to leave the area. the rooms were inviting and very clean. the staff did everything to make you feel that you were important and that they were glade to see you.
"the old holiday inn alexandria has been given a top-to-bottom update as a the kimpton monaco. very comfortable, very well-done."
near shops and excellent restaurants. staff is super friendly and helpful!
great experience. will definitely stay here again!!
"everything makes you feel at home, especially that you can bring your do with you and know that he is welcome."
"booked online,  showed up and was given a different room to what i had requested . also tv in room was broken."
"i don't want to leave a lengthy review - suffice it to stay, if you're on the fence, book a room. it is very elegant, the staff is extremely hospitable, and the location is top notch. my only complaint is that they charge $20/day for parking, but that's easily fixed by parking around the corner (plenty of spots at night!)"
the service was excellent!! everyone was very friendly and helpful! our room was big with an oversized chair and king bed. the hotel is 12 blocks from the metro-an easy walk or they have a shuttle. i would definatly stay here again!
hotel monaco was absolutely phenomenal and provided the highest quality service to both the human and canine guests. the front desk was warm and inviting and the room was five star quality. the hotel provided our dog with her own doggy bag and provided ample pet friendly information for the surrounding area. having had bad experiences with other hotel chains (i.e. marriot) we cannot express enough our thanks to the hotel monaco and kimpton hotels as a whole. there is no doubt we will seek out this chain of hotels for all of our future travels.
"hotel located in ideal place to explore alexandria, va. walking distance to all attractions (marina, park, all places on king st, etc.). hotel is next door to saturday market...staff extremely helpful and accommodating.restaurant very good...parking convenient but expensive..."
i could go on and on..... i won't. totally awesome hotel and location.
"i thought the room rates were a little pricy for the amenities offered. the room did not include a microvave, which would have been useful."
not too bad of a place. definitely wouldn't pay the full $500 the site says they normally run. the bed was comfortable but the pillows were way to soft. great location though.
was a wonderful location to potomac river and all the walking and bike paths was great.
while we watched tv in our room the tv would turn off randomly. the room beside us had a dog and it continuously barked. the parking was horrible!!
"location,location,location.  whimsical, swanky, yet not a budget buster on price, even has a pool!  hotel is located in the middle of the ""scene"" in old town alexandria.  super convenient to lots of restaurants - from budget to high end.  shopping possibilities abound if that's what you want.  free shuttle runs to the metro staion 10 blocks away.  metro to anywhere in dc.  loved it."
updated hotelwalking distance to old townfriendly service
"hotel is very well located. easy access to restaurants, shopping, art museum and harbor. staff was extremely cordial and helpful. the room was lovely!"
"this is my second time staying here and i like where it is in old alexandria. however, the bathrooms and showers could use a facelift. the beds were too soft and lacked support underneath. very nice staff"
good experience. clean and comfortable. staff is very sweet and professional.
the facility was good and the location was convenient. i had room service that was excellent.
"very nice hotel, convenient to all the things nice in old town alexandria, va.  great alternative hotel stay if you plan to visit the new mgm national harbor casino...super easy cab or drive to mgm.   clean, spacious hotel room ( courtyard view room).  very friendly hotel staff...very pleased with my choice in hotels."
my best stay in the past 20 travels (2 years). the room was really clean. it had a minibar full of items (i love munching on snacks   prices were really good)parking was the only thing ($27/night) which i guess is normal for that area.
hotel is in a great location. the staff was exceptionally nice and helpful. i would stay again and recommend this hotel. our room was small and did not have an easy chair. overall a pleasant experience.
"we loved it! excellent ratings for: room, service, comfort, cleanliness, location, parking. the whole thing was great and fun. perfect for a night out in old towne alexandria."
"this is centrally located on king street and has very attentive staff. free shuttle to reagan international is a great plus. the jackson 20 restaurant adjoining has excellent presentation meals, and very nicely prepared. hotel is quiet."
"we spent easter weekend at hotel monaco with our dog, and we all had a lovely time. the daily wine reception gave us the opportunity to meet other people and other dogs from all over the country. the old town location was superb; we were within walking distance of many excellent restaurants and other attractions. the staff was friendly and gracious; they couldn't do enough for us. we felt so much at home at the monaco, we were reluctant to leave. we definitely would stay at this hotel again and would heartily recommend it to others."
"it's a modern motif but structurally old so there were some minor issues, like the heating system was kind of loud. woke me up more than once. parking was expensive. but, for the location & the price, i would stay there again."
"we appreciated that this hotel was pet friendly. very comfortable and inviting lobby area with fireplace. a riverside park, great restaurants and shopping all within walking distance of the hotel."
"jright in the heart of alexandria. lots of restaurants and stores nearby. cheerful, warm lobby and good service. morning coffee in the lobby which is always nice. good design and service."
"we spent one night prior to attending a family wedding in quantico. greeting as we pulled up was friendly as was the check in process. room was small, bed uncomfortable and when i sat on the end it tipped forward. bath sink was clogged. staff in hotel dining room was excellent as was the food. neighborhood great for walking, shopping and dining. check out easy and friendly. overnight parking charge seemed ridiculous especially when paying such a high price for a room."
"our room wasn't ready at check-in and we were given a free upgrade so we could get settled. front desk staff made great recommendations for local restaurants. hotel was clean, comfortable, and the bath robes were hillarious. i look forward to staying at hotel monaco again."
"this hotel is on ""the"" street to be on in old town- king street! the beds were super comfortable. no in-room coffee or in-hotel vending machines (soft drinks) were slight minuses. great place for breakfast (and lunch for that matter) next door at la madaline's!"
"good room, good location, good pool. just what i needed!"
"it was the perfect hotel for our stay. the rooms were great, decor upscale and the overall ambiance perfect for our visit to the heart of old town. don't overlook the complimentary airport shuttle service and daily wine tasting."
hotel was fabulous.  the style and setting of the hotel is fitting for old town alexandria.
"the staff was very friendly and helpful. the hotel was nice and clean. it had a nice old time feel perfectly mixed with modern amenities. it was clean, the bed was comfortable, and walking distance to many restaurants and shops. it was also only around 7-8 miles from downtown dc. i'm definitely coming back :)"
location was awesome. everything was great. i recommend it.
"not super fancy, but nice enough. good location - nice to grab breakfast at the farmer's market across the street."
"exceptional staff. beautiful, cozy room with unique design. wished to have been closer to a metro stop."
"this hotel was thoroughly enjoyable and a charming treat for both my husband and i, as well as our 2 boys (7 & 11). kids hour at 4pm, followed by wine hour at 5pm, allowed us all to feel as though we were welcomed guests. the pool was kept at a comfortable temperature and we spent many hours there during the week. would stay here over and over again!"
could not have had a better time or a better place to stay.
"amazing...beautiful decor and atmosphere. super nice staff...soooo accomodating! offered many small special things like a personal live fish for my daughter and chalk board, her own little animal print robe. i stuffed dog with story book for her to enjoy. the complimentary wine hour was such a nice treat and social event. pool was great...cant wait to go back!"
"attended the wedding of our daughter's friend. the hotel did an excellent job with the ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner. thoroughly enjoyable. our room was well appointed, but could have used an additional easy chair for both balance esthetically and for comfort. the desk chair and easy chair worked, but wasn't ideal for conversation. the restaurant was bustling in the morning and the wait staff hustled, but couldn't really keep up with the demand."
"we stayed at the monaco from 7/5/11 - 7/7/11 and were really pleased. i have stayed at many 5 star hotels and had not-so-great experiences ... this one was a breath of fresh air.from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everyone was always smiling, pleasant and very helpful. we were checked in very quickly and our room (two double beds) was big, very clean and smelled nice. the bathroom was so sparkling clean that my son (who is very picky) couldn't wait to take a bath (fyi, we are generally shower people.) yes, the a/c unit can be loud, but when you're tired from a day of sightseeing and full from a big dinner ... all i can say is that i slept very well. i personally would have preferred a firmer mattress but that is really the only complaint i can make. when i realized that i had left my toothbrush and showercap at home, i called the front desk and housekeeping was at my door in 5 minutes with complimentary toiletries. as for wi-fi, just sign up on their website to join their club (no charge) and you will get your internet for free. i even read that you can get coupons for some free mini-bar use.my brother and his wife were on the trip with us and their room, with a king bed, was smaller than ours. being from europe, they are not fans of a/c to begin with and the loud noise theirs was making made it hard for them to sleep. they finally called guest services to complain because they couldn't turn if off either and were immediately moved to another room (just to sleep in) for the night. the next day while we were out, they had an engineer come in and fix the unit. by the time we came back, it was working fine and there was a bottle of wine waiting for them for their troubles.i did like the decor of the lobby ... colorful and eclectic but in a nice way. the location itself was great because it was so close to great shops and restaurants. there is a french cafe next door which was great for breakfast. we tried dinner at the restaurant downstairs ... although my dinner was good (bucket of fried chicken), my brother felt that the ribs and bbq chicken were a bit dry. overall, not worth the money we spent. the wait staff, however, was very efficient and friendly.the next night we tried an italian restaurant up the street ... bartucci's. this place was great! their pastas were homemade and the seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. great wine selection also. this place was worth it and we will definitely go back next time we are in town.overall, i found our stay very satisfying and reasonably priced. checkout was quick and they even e-mailed me my bill. based on my experience, i would definitely go back and i would recommend this place without hesitation!"
"this hotel was in the heart of old town, making it a great location for visiting alexandria, with just a stroll down to the waterfront. the hotel decor gave it a stylish boutique feel and it was a great place to come back to after a day at a conference or shopping. a nice touch was the complimentary wine social hour in the lobby each evening. guests participation was high, creating a lively social vibe. eat at restaurant eve, right around the corner on pitt street for high-end craft cocktails, stellar service and ambiance, and some of the best dining in old town."
"loved the robes they provide you with, the bathroom floors were a bit chilly (they were made of marble).  the bed was very comfortable and we were very happy with our choice."
"the hotel is right on king street, so it's easy to explore old town alexandria by foot.  the front desk clerk who checked me in made me feel welcome not only in the hotel but also in the city by giving me a brief summary of the attractions near the hotel (waterfront, shops).  my room was lovely: clean, lots of light, and plenty of outlets.  although i'm not a marriott rewards member, they gave me the wifi password so i could access internet in my room.  i only stayed here for one night, but i would definitely recommend it to others."
we loved the monaco. convenient to everything. front desk staff was terrific.
ritzy place. wide screen hd tv in the room. valet parking is required and costs $20 per day. great location.
"top notch decorating and ambiance, very clean, comfortable, nice bed linens...quiet for the most part. i had one bad evening where a party was down the hall at 2 a.m. the hotel staff was fairly responsive, though the party-throwers were not! the location was excellent for exploring alexandria, accessing dc and other sights like mt vernon."
this hotel was great!my dog was treated like a true guest - greeted with dog treats!location is perfect to explore old town alexandria.
"great time, enjoyed the wine hour in the early evening. the only thing i didn't like was the coffee that was out out in the mornings, truly watered down- and i wouldn't be fm difficult if they didn't advertise it as artisan coffee. spend less money on the cool design on the cups, and more on the quality of the coffee."
the hotel was lovely and the staff could not have been nicer. unfortunately we had to check out early due to illness. they were able to refund us our second night without question. we will definitely go back and enjoy the hotel and alexandria again.
"seriously, the employees at this hotel, the front desk to the housekeepers to the doormen, are some of the friendliest, most competent, helpful and conscientious folks we have found. we travel quite alot, and we find this hotel to be world class! great location in the heart of old town alexandria, one can be entertained, wined & dined for days within walking distance, no car required. dog friendly, but you'd never know there are dogs except for seeing them in the lobby... fun! room amenities were wonderful... cushy bed/pillows/bedding, big screen tv, stylish furnishings, trendy decor and high end finishes. the lobby is so well appointed with decor and fireplace that people use it regularly to relax! free coffee/tea/hot chocolate in mornings, free wine in afternoon. wow, we love this place, and definitely will be back!"
"my company hq having moved to crystal city from dc provided me with an excellent opportunity to get away from the usual georgetown or dupont circle haunts and i was very glad i did.the hotel monaco (there's a sister hotel in dc near the mall) was quirky but comfortable and the room, while a little small by normal us standards, was unusually designed, well appointed and extremely comfortable, with free, fast wifi for the workers among us. the staff were all helpful without being gushing and the hotel was well positioned for the excellent restaurants of old town alexandria. if you're a dog lover this is a great place to be - they have doggie happy hours twice a week when our canine chums can bring their owners along for a pre-dinner drink. old town alexandria itself is a friendly place just a few stops on the metro from national airport and onwards to dc. lots of shops and restaurants and very pleasant just for a stroll around - a welcome relaxation after a busy working day, you could almost be home."
super stay in old town. hotel staff was very friendly.
"i was very satisfied with our stay, the staff was friendly and helpful. the room was comfortable and well laid out. the hotel was at a great location and the sites of old town were within walking distance. will stay there again on our next visit to alexandria. ."
"i had stayed in 6 hotels over 4 weeks, and this was the best. not only clean and comfortable, but great water pressure in the shower."
the trolley runs throughout the day and can take you to metro station. jump on the metro and you're in d.c within 30 minutes! loved the hotel!
this was just a gorgeous hotel! the location on king street was perfect. very comfortable room and luxurious bathroom. probably the nicest hotel i have been to in the dc area. recommended to couples as well as families. will certainly stay here again.
"i love the monaco, and the location.  i have been staying at that location since 1980 because i love old town.  please keep up the good work so when i am back in va it will always be as comfortable."
"the monaco is located on kings street, the main street in old town alexandria. walk along king street to wonderful shops and restaurants.  a short walk to the waterfront. if you drive into town the hotel has underground parking which wonderful because parking downtown can be difficult."
the things that made this a true 4 star: service was great & the hotel looked pretty. things that made this more like a 2 star: cleanliness regardless of how many times i complained was very poor (we found a glass under the bed and it looked like it was there for months); they did not replace essentials such as lotion etc.; and the bed gave me the worst back pain ever!
"nice hotel, and very friendly staff. complimentary wine happy hour was nice, as was life guard at pool. room was a little tight for 4 of us, but it was as big as most hotel rooms would be, nothing more. shuttle to dca airport was nice, trolley to metro was convenient. unfortunately, trolley doesn't start until 11:30 pm and there is no shuttle to the metro so we walked a lot more than we expected we would. overall, we would stay again."
"i chose the hotel monaco because i've had such wonderful experiences with them in other cities. moreover, the expedia rate included transportation to and from the hotel to the airport. i called before embarqing from the west coast to ensure i could be picked up when my flight landed at 10:06 p.m. ""oh, yes. just call us."" the reality was that i was advised the ""last shuttle"" had come and gone and to take a cab. the hotel staff offered a prefuntory ""sorry"" and did nothing else. this was a promise that was not delivered and left me feeling less than happy. dj"
we reserved at the hotel monaco( kimpton) and stayed at a marriott.(they changed owners the day before we arrived!!)  big difference!  we were not advised in advance!!  there was no coffee pot in the room!  no robes! and no fish!  and no goodies at breakfast buffet!  just coffee.  no break on the price even though we were the guinea pigs for all the new employees.  oh sorry we got cookies and milk!will not stay again!!
"king street ,located near restaurants and shops, wine reception with good wine, pleasant and helpful staff."
very clean room. great central location. you can pretty much walk to everything. helpful and friendly staff !it would've been great if they provide you microwave and refrigerator also.
very convenient to downtown alexandria.  right in the middle of everything with relatively easy access to highwaysto travel around dc.
the room smelled heavily of some strong chemical. had to have it sprayed to minimize the odor. lobby had some smell too. dogs barking the first night and kids shouting and playing at 3am second night made sleeping impossible. hotel is very convenient to old town and decorations are nice but i won't go back.
"we stayed over the past 3 day easter weekend. old town alexandria is a great area; nice restaurants, shopping atmosphere. hotel was nice. rooms were comfortable. only problem was that the wet bar was locked every night when we came back. both nights i called to have them unlock; the first night it took over 1 hour, the 2nd night almost 35 minutes. other than that, pleasant stay."
"my best friend and i went to alexandria and stayed at the hotel monaco. it was a perfect stay, with a perfect room and perfect staff. we didn't want to leave. a huge thank you to sam and andrew for exceptional service."
"great room, great place. room service order was wrong twice, clear communication, order repeated back correctly. hard to figure...."
the hotel is very clean and in a great location.  there are a ton of shops and restaurants on king street and the metro stop is about a mile away for easy quick travel into dc.  i would definitely stay here again.
the hotel is convenient and short walk to the tourist area of alexandria. about 12 blocks from metro into dc. bellhop/valet do not speak english and are inconsistent at providing service. front desk staff - one was pleasant the other was condescending. got charged for a night we didn't use along with the parking - am still trying to argue it out with the management. front desk clerk blamed expedia.would not stay here again.
"stayed there for a quick weekend trip, recommended by a local of alexandria, and she was right, monaco was a great place to stay at. well decorated, clean room and well insulated. best part is location, $15 taxi from airport to hotel, walking distance to waterfront and king st is a riot itself. absolutely lovely.the only thing i'd hope they improve on is the noisy ac. it gives heart attacks when it kicks in."
i was very impressed with the little attention to details here. wow. awesome stay.
"great staff and have stayed here many times.  room i was in was starting to look a little ""worn"".  chips on door to bath, faded wallpaper and tears in vinyl headboard."
"we love this hotel and stay there every time we are in alexandria. it is in the middle of shops, restaurants, historical venues, etc."
"the hotel monaco is a boutique hotel.  the attendants were especially helpful and the checkin was fine.  the room was clean, the bed comfortable and came with a flat screen hdtv.  we were there for a wedding and the reception was held in the hotels facilities.  a courtyard was utilized for appetizers and drinks before the reception.  service was excellent, the appetizers were tasty and readily available.  the reception meal was very well done, food excellent and service very good.  a breakfast was held in the morning and it was a disaster.  the service was terrible, items ordered never delivered.  waited an hour before getting two cups of tea, served piecemeal; first i got my pot, minutes later my wife got her pot, and 10 minutes later we got our tea bags.  we waited an hour between our order and the time it was served and my wife never got her toast for her eggs.  the manager came round and apologized for the poor service and said they were just overwhelmed.  with 10 years of experience in hotel dining rooms and myself serving 12 tables for 3 meals every day as well as being the head waiter; i cannot imagine why everything else was so great and this meal such a disaster."
"the hotel monaco is very close to our favorite pub, murphy""s. the location is so convenient to the pub and other restaurants and shop we enjoy. we definitely will stay again and probably bring our cat along the next time."
"the hotel overall was great, but just after 10pm i could smell a strong odor of weed (i cant use the actual name of the drug that was buring, since it appears that the comment program does not allow the word to be used, i guess the truth is not acceptable) coming from the hallway.  i went out of my room and the hall was smokey.  i reported this to the front desk, and they investigated it, but told me there was nothing they could do since they couldn't tell which room it was coming from.  i had to stuff a towel under my door to try and keep the smell out, and it would have been nice if they would have atleast did something to vent the air in the hallway.  other then this incident, it is a beautiful hotel in a prime location.  i just expected to actually enjoy my room for the money that i spent."
love the new morning coffe 7 evening wine served in the lobby.
we were leaving early for a trip and the airport shuttle was quick and easy.
"we recently celebrated our anniversary at this beautiful property in old town alexandria, va. upon arrival there was a card with berries and chocolate from the management. the room was amazing with a full tub with jacuzzi. the only problem is that the hotel is currently experiencing some electrical problems and is being powered by a generator. if you book a room this summer you might want to request a room away from that side of the hotel since it does create noise and fumes. the hotel was very responsive to our concerns and we look forward to returning to this property once their electrical issues have been resolved."
i loved the room and the atmosphere was modern and chic very city like that a total oasis
"it was great! could use another mirror of some sort in the general area of the bedroom there's a long mirror in the hall but it's not very useful. decor is interesting but much too busy in the hallways in particular. priced well, good area, and easy access. would stay here again."
i've stayed on two different occasions in the past couple of years. staff are very friendly and helpful. enjoyed the wine social in the evenings. best location in old town!
"very upscale hotel right in the heart of everything. a beautiful mix of patterns and colors throughout the hotel. expansive rooms, ours had a balcony. staff was warm and jackson 20 restaurant was wonderful for sunday brunch. definitely staying here again."
"beautiful, well decorated and clean hotel. loved it! terrible rattling ac in the room that could use maintenance but the bathroom, bed and everything in the room was perfect besides that."
"very pet-friendly hotel, the rooms are extremely new and clean, the bed was very comfortable, flat screen t.v., excellent location in old town.  we have stayed there twice now and the staff was very nice and helpful both times.  valet parking made life very easy."
very nice location. rooms were beautiful. bathroom door had no lock (fyi) intentionally.
"we had a wonderful stay. the stay were very friendly and helpful, the room was clean and very comfortable, and the location is great."
"we had a fantastic stay here and a great time. a few slight mishaps: fire alarm went off one morning and we were left outside for about an hour, the minifridge in our room wasn't working and as of the end of our 4 nights still wasn't, and for 3 days the ice machine on our floor wasn't working. its a little far out of dc (about 15-20mins on metro), but alexandria was worth it. overall, a wonderful time."
"what a wonderful place to stay! a great hotel with character and excitement! an excellent location. and an incredible staff! majid and bk are just a couple of the wonderful employees of hotel monaco. they made my stay relaxing, entertaining- and just fabulous!looking forward to my next trip back!"
"i remember this hotel when it was a holiday inn and it is so pretty now and the rooms are very comfortable. the best thing about the hotel is the location though, it's right on king street the main street in old town and so central to everything and in walking distance of great restaurants and the river etc.. we had a lovely night there."
friendly staff. excellent wines. delicious food. only recommendation: water temperature too low.
"nice place to stay , but took us 2 different rooms to move from til we received what was acceptable to what was advertised. when we went to have the wonderful breakfast room service brought us, after a comfortable sleep, one of the chairs was unusable without a creative mind and the table slanted so steep that our coffee spilt. not a big deal really.overall, after a few digs, i would return there again to say hi to the friendly staff. great location to stay for a nationals game."
very nice and friendly staff.  the dogs were not a distraction.  great festive atmosphere for christmas.
"only stayed one night, but wish i had more time to stay there. it was very close to everything old town has to offer. very comfortable rooms."
"we loved the room. the bed was very comfortable. both the room and the bathroom were generous in size. the location was perfect for our planned sight seeing trip. we both noticed that there were no intrusive noises coming from either the hall or the neighboring rooms. our only issue was with the shower. we booked a room with a ""roll in shower"" because that was what was available, but the construction of the shower floor and the length of the shower curtain allowed us to ""flood"" the bathroom. fortunately there was a drain in the bathroom floor and with all the available towels we were able to contain and direct the mess."
"nice hotel, close to restaurants & waterfront. expensive minibar!"
"i am a daily swimmer, and i loved the pool! the wine reception each late afternoon was an added touch. all personnel were exceptionally courteous and helpful, especially the doormen. they also provided complimentary shuttle to reagan airport and amtrak station, which was a nice added touch."
food was a little priceystaff was pleasant although i question the need for a credit card # when i had already prepaid my room
i didn't get either a queen bed or free wifi without arguing a lot with the desk staff - and showing my reservation confirmation.
"quite a change from the old holiday inn which occupied the building originally. best location and very trendy. cordless phone had been mangled and was beeping bec. battery was gone. we unplugged and hotel engineer just plugged it back in. problem was note fixed. no shower cap in bathroom, would have to request it. very busy. nice happy hour."
"called multiple times for roomservice no answer. called for an ipad charger and a hair brush; was told no charger and hair brush only a comb i available.  meanwhile the sign in the room says if we don't have it, we'll go get it.  the turndown service ppl were rude giving dirty looks when asked for towels especially the men"
i wa really happy with the stay. we went up for a redskins game. hotel conveniently located in old town near murphy's pub. staff was excellent; the room was well appointed - even had night clothes you could buy in the closet. i left behind a nice leather coat w/ sentimental value. called a few days later. they had found it and shipped it via fed ex. i asked to pay for the shipping and they insisted on covering the cost. a nice touch in my opinion. i have no reservations referring this hotel.
"excellent staff! very kind and helpful, the place has the aura of home somehow--small but useful touches, such as cold lemonade, great coffee and tea, apples... makes it like home.  clean rooms, and cleaning staff are careful not to get in your way. location in alexandria is excellent, with a pharmacy close by, and transport links too. i will be returning, and by then i hope the metro is fixed so access to dc is better given the traffic jams of the city."
this hotel was in a perfect location for wandering around historic alexandria. it was very clean and well-appointed. it was the nicest kimpton hotel i've ever stayed in. i highly recommend it.
i was disappointed with my stay at this hotel. my room looked out on a party that was happening in a courtyard outside my window and was very noisy late into the night. the bed was too soft for my liking. asked for memory foam pillow and it really wasn't memory foam. and to top it all off i left a pair of sandals in the room and there was no chance they were left anywhere else and they were never turned into housekeeping. staff was not receptive in finding my sandals. disappointed
"the food was great especially the b.e.l.t breakfast sandwich; good coffee, too, not that weak as water stuff hotels usually serve. kings street location has many shopping and food options. a great location with access to dc via the metro.i look forward to my next trip."
"great hotel, very convenient for meeting and for access into city"
great hotel right on king street. location could not have been better. furnishings in the room and lobby were very nice. staff were polite and helpful. only complaint was the parking was a bit pricey. i would suggest parking in another ramp if you don't mind walking a few blocks.
"delightful place - great style, very friendly service, and the most comfortable hotel bed i've slept in in many a moon."
"alexandria is a wonderful place to stay and to have easy access to all the sites and attractions in washington dc. the hotel is in the heart of the city but very quiet inside. kimpton hotels are some of my favorites; i stay in them in many different cities around the country. each one is uniquely decorated and has its own character, so it definitely does not feel like a chain. and yet they all conform to high standards of service, hospitality, and quality"
this hotel is a real gem. the staff if fantastic and the other amenities make it a winner. make sure to stop by the wine happy hour at 5:00 and visit with other guests. i also love that this hotel allows pets and that locals and guests with pets have happy hour in the courtyard on tuesdays and thursday. old town is a great place to stay when visiting dc. this hotel is just a few blocks from the metro and you can take that in to see the dc sights and then return to adorable king street in alexandria for a great dinner and shopping.
"my mom, sister & i stayed for a ""girls"" weekend. we had a blast! such a unique hotel...very clean! super memories made here!!"
"great hotel, super location for business in washington dc."
helpful and friendly staff. i would stay there again. only down side is the time it takes to walk (12 blocks) to the metro station and metro trip to get into dc.
i loved the stay at this hotel. it felt like a home away from home. t have two minor complaints; there is no privacy from the room and bathroom and the door greeters were a little slow so most of the time we opened the doors ourselves. that is not an issue for us not a big deal when we look at a hotel.
our room wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet. we had to get our keys reprogrammed each day. the room doors slam shut and there isn't much noise proofing so that woke us up. the free wi-fi is only free after you sign up for a loyalty program. it is nicely decorated though.
everything about this hotel is pretty positive except---the a/c in the room was terribly loud! could not switch because they were booked!
"rooms and reception are ok (value for money), but the restaurant is substandard: staff negligent and careless. choice and quality are sub optimal. not value for money, and not what you would expect. breakfast has been bad experience."
…just fantastic on all fronts…like all kimpton hotels
beautiful hotel in one of america's most historic areas. the staff is friendly and efficient. the setting is perfect for business or pleasure. great walking area.
very comfortable and friendly hotel in the middle of old alexandria. everyone was very friendly and helpful. would definitely stay here again.
"the hotel is centrally located, and the room was spacious and beautifully furnished. the other facilities are tastefully decorated, but small, given the grandeur the hotel is trying to portray. there are amenities, but with nearly everything with this hotel, it comes at an additional cost (parking, wifi, etc). the staff is friendly, but lacking a professional demeanor, and information regarding services and benefits provided will only come if you know to ask (wine and breakfast). we looked forward for some time to staying here, and now that we have, it is unlikely that we'll repeat."
"funky little place. wine hour (that we didn't utilize). the soaps smelled great. the bed was comfortable, which is rare in the hotel industry. i'd go back. i though it was a little high priced, but then again, i'm accustomed to vegas hotel prices."
"staff was attentive and friendly, room was nice, absolutely no complaints"
always a treat to return to hotel monaco. our recent overnight stay came during one of alexandria's muggiest days. stepping into the hotel lobby - the front door is almost always opened by a staff member- was a cool retreat from the oppressive heat. we missed the complimentary wine reception by 15 minutes so the hotel clerk gave us vouchers for drinks at the bar. our third floor room fronted busy king st. but we experienced minimal street noise. beautifully decorated room- lots of light. great value for location and amenities
"visiting dc on business. can recommend this hotel and the area to women on their own. wine reception is a nice touch. chance to meet varied and interesting guests. only complaint was slight lack of info on arrival and no help to room offered.very friendly in attached restaurant. basic room is a bit small but very comfy and bathroom facility is classy.i stayed in dc for five days but couldn't find a reasonably priced option for entirety of my stay. which is why i ended up in alexandria. obviously not as convenient for dc but metro is quick, safe and cheap. taxi was $25. lots to see and do both historic and gourmet."
hotel was really nice. boutiquie but not off the wall. nice restaurant with a cool bar. oldtown alexandria is a great area; there's a lot to do within walking distance.
had a wonderful stay at hotel monaco.  the staff makes this an extra special place to stay.  this hotel is pet friendly and i loved seeing all the beautiful dogs in the lobby.  10 minutes from national harbor maryland and 20 from washington dc.  explored all areas including beautiful alexandria itself.  would stay again!
"this is a good hotel with excellent and friendly staff, and there are plenty of perks, such as an airport shuttle to reagan national airport, coffee in the am, wine in the pm."
"terrific location in old town. staff was always bright, friendly and efficient. room was spacious, quiet and comfortable. room service was prompt, food delivered hot."
"loved the location, the unique and comfortable room, the wine mix and mingle hour and the friendly staff."
"right in the middle of ole town alexandria. n street parking was not a problem. i try not to pay a hotel an extra $20/night when i'm already paying alot for the hotel. my car can sleep on the street. the tv kept losing the picture and there was a slight plumming problem, but the attention was immediate. very friendly service."
checked in had prepaid room; made to put $100 deposit a day deposit could not access funds had made prior arrangements to use bombay room woman came in and embarrassed us and wanted us to leave;   she then said we could stay if we took table clothes off table;  she refused to double check;   she found out she was wrong and never apologizedno complimentary coffee in room.  told we could not use restuarant unless reservationno complimentary wifi yet it was listed as amentity on reservation
this hotel is in the center of olde town alexandria with plenty to see and do all around it. the hotel has just been beautifully renovated and the rooms were excellent with very comfortable beds.  we ate in the restaraunt and found the food excellent and the service good and friendly.  the restaraunt is noisy however.  wonderful luxery hotel that is also dog friendly.
"had two grandchildren first night, dined in hotel restaurant for dinner and breakfast with accommodation for children. pool was nice amenity. doormen were very responsive and check-in and out efficient and courteous."
our overnight stay was wonderful! very relaxing in a beautiful hotel. we would love to visit again for a longer stay.
"i am thoroughly impressed and deeply grateful to the staff at the monaco. from my frantic phone call to announce my extremely late arrival, to loaning me a phone charger to replace the one i forgot. the front desk staff quickly calmed my concerns, and welcomed me with open arms upon arrival. the hotel is situated in a beautiful area that i spent hours exploring the next day. it is also a convenient, and inexpensive cab ride to all the fabulousness in d.c. checking in and out was a complete breeze, and i was even given directions to a nearby garage which cost less than five buck for entire stay. my room was beautiful and cozier than home. i am a huge fan of kimpton because hotels like the monaco set a standard that other brands simply cannot meet."
"super cute hotel, friendly and helpful staff, and really comfy room.alexandria could not have been a more relaxing little weekend getaway."
"great location and beautiful area.... we had an issue with a dog barking across the hall from us (it is a pet friendly hotel) that was not handled well.  also, little things like the morning coffee being cold were not what you would expected from a ""nice"" hotel."
why write endless words when i can simply say the hotel accommodations are excellent!
"great little find in the heart of old town! we found it online because they accept pets and was near the venue we were attending. very pet friendly - awesome room and staff. we stayed by chance, but will make it a destination next time. and on saturday mornings it is right across from a huge farmers market which we loved shopping at. we even found a fun little antique chest from the 1800's and of course great produce! get there early though because they close the farmers market at 11am."
i was in virginia for training. your hotel was fabulous! i felt very welcome and loved the area.
"my family of three stayed at the hotel monaco during our sightseeing vacation to washington dc. the room was magnificent with comfortable beds, a well stocked refrigerator and internet access. we did walk the 11 blocks to the king street metro station the first day, but on the following 3 days we caught the dash bus right across the street from the hotel. it cost us $1.25 each and the tickets were good for the whole day, so we could ride back to the hotel also. we would definitely stay at the hotel monaco again. the only complaint we have is that for the last 3 nights of our stay, they had no towels at the pool so we had to bring the handtowels from our room."
"was a bit disappointed with the fitness center.  when i come to alexandria i always like to stay at the monaco b/c of the fitness center.  its small, but has what i need.  but this time, there were weights missing.  there was no jump rope.  and the water cooler was empty.  not good.  i may consider another hotel next time."
"all i can say is: elegant! the staff was professional, courteous, and helpful. only criticism i have is that check-in is at 3 p.m. and i would have preferred an earlier check-in. excellent exercise room and smallish but comfortable pool. pricey, but well-worth it!"
enjoy all of our kimpton stays. lobby was lovely and service great. perfect location in alexandria! free shuttle to and from dca saved us cab fare! definitely recommend!
hotel well situated in alexandriaour room was in the far top corner of the hotel therefore it took more than five minutes of running the hot water tap in order to receive tepid waterother issue toilet ran very slow and was blocked had to call housekeeping a number of times to get this issue rectifiedin future we will ensure we have a centrally located room
"the room and staff were exceptional - except for the lobby area. i was there 2 days and both days the coffee service was out. the front desk staff insisted they were ""on it"" but after 15-20 minutes, still no coffee. the lobby was generally crowded in the mornings as well. not enough seating for the number of people hanging around - probably waiting for their coffee as well. i like kimpton properties but this one needs a bit of help from the management."
i am from the area so i knew of the hotel but had never stayed there so i was pleasantly surprised to see the quality of service and the really fantastic decor inside each and every detail of the hotel. i knew it was well located to going out and about in old town alexandria but there is also an airport shuttle and people were very helpful in getting more information about transportation to washington etc. i got a great rate on hotels.com so that made it more worth it. i would pay the regular prices if i was only going to be there for a few nights but if you can get the rate for better it really stands above the other local options like the holiday or comfort inn. i was very impressed with the high quality.
centrally located to everything you need. 5 years running have stayed here for the st. patrick's day parade. love this hotel!
"very comfortable, friendly staff, excellent breakfast, convenient to the king street boutique shops."
everything was wonderful. except my room wasn't ready at check-in time. had to wait about an hour. other than that everything was wonderful
"friendly, helpful staff. near shopping and restaurants in old alexandria, walking distance."
"enjoyed my stay here very much, the bed was very comfortable and bathroom amenities luxurious. would stay here again!"
"i had used hotel.com points for a discounted room and had read somewhere online that when you book with points or free nights that hotels give you there worst room. i believe it now. my room was tucked away in the farthest corner with a view of the dirty rooftop. there was a humming sound coming from outside that i didn't know would become irritating while sleeping. one set of friends had to move rooms because they didn't have hot water. the next morning they ordered breakfast through room service and gave up after 1 1/2 hours of no breakfast. i found out during the night that my room had no heat. when i first checked in, i just dropped my bags in the room and left to meet my group, so didn't notice that there was a problem. i returned late in the evening and it was cool in the room so adjusted the thermostat thinking it would heat up while i was sleeping. no such luck, at 3 am i woke up and it was 63 degrees in my room. since i didn't want to deal with an engineer at that time of night, i bundled up, cranked the thermostat to 84 went back to bed. at 6:30, i gave up, showered and went down to the lobby where it was warm to await by friends. when i checked out, i told the clerk that they should check the heat since i had the thermostat cranked to 84 and it was still only 63 degrees. i was given a $7.50 breakfast for my trouble.thank god i had a discounted rate, this hotel is expensive for what it is and what it offers. and why no coffee in the rooms?"
"nice hotel, comfortable room, friendly staff.  great location right on king street."
"ended up with a room where windows faced brick wall,so was disappointed with that. otherwise stay was perfectly nice. very dog friendly hotel and area, which was great for us."
"i loved the location, gorgeous decor, complimentary coffee and tea in the morning, the pool (although i wish it wasn't shut down for four hours between 10-2), onsite parking with valet and in and out options and nearby restaurants.the check in was a bit rocky because the woman who checked me in took my name, disappeared for 10 minutes to tend to something else, while i thought she was tending to my check in.  she returned and asked me my name again and began the checkout process.  she offered no apology and failed to give me the correct pool hours, which i learned of after i visited the pool ready for a swim only to learn that it was closed for four hours midday.   the management should train its desk staff to be professional, courteous and to know the basic facts of the hotel's amenities."
"we stayed at the hotel monaco this saturday to attend a game at fedex field. this was our second time staying with the hotel and it was just as good as i remembered from two years ago. unfortunately this stay much much shorter:(.we arrived just about when complementary wine hour began. had just enough time to get to our room, freshen up and have a couple of glasses of vino. i enjoyed the merlot while my dh have the white (didn't notice what kind). the red was wonderful!our room was nice and very clean. the only issue was the mini bar fridge wasn't working. after notifying the front desk, they sent someone right on it while we were out for dinner.morning coffee is excellent, however i wish coffee was in the room for better convenience. thank goodness i had someone willing to go downstairs and get some to bring back to the room.while staying, there were two weddings going on and lots of people dressed in suits and so on... i felt a little intimidated only because we weren't dressed to the nines. while sitting in wine hour, the lobby got very crowded and loud with the wedding parties but we were able to score a spot, find a place for dinner and do a little yuppie watching.all in all, this place is great! the location can't be beat and it's not too pretentious."
"i really loved this hotel.  there were wine tastings every night from 5pm-6pm.  the decorations were incredible, the rooms were nice, sized just right for business.  there were two robes wonderfully hanging in the closet and a flat screen tv with a great picture.  i looked forward to going back to the room after a day of meetings."
"prior to staying at this hotel, i stayed in the monaco in portland and expected a similar level of service and excellence of the room. the walls are paper thin and the guy in the next room kept me up all night snoring. the air-conditioning system is ancient and stopped working in the middle of the night. before it stopped altogether the hotel engineer came in and said that it needed replacing. it took 2 calls to get room service to call me back after they said they would call in a minute (i waited 30 mins). the menu was hit and miss with changes and deletions and snotty attitude about special requests. it seemed a rather amateur operation overall and i won't return."
"close to sites, restaurants...hotel is lovely ..rooms,fridge well equipped! pet friendly."
great hotel!  we have stayed hear every year for new years. perfect place to enjoy all akexandria has to offer.
very friendly and helpful staff.very comfortable room.
the hotel was great! i think that the location is great and right in the middle of old town. the hotel was great and service was excellent. i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great room ready to relax.
this hotel was great! the service was great and the prices were good as well. it was my wife and i one year anniversary and they made it so special. great location and great people.
"we had a great stay at the hotel monaco.  we were there for 6 nights. the location was perfect. the staff were helpful.  the standard king room was spacious.  we had a street view of king street, which was great.  the restaurant and bar had excellent service.  we traveled into dc 3 days and had 2 days of day trips.  we were very close to mt vernon and traveled to anapolis and baltimore the other day.  we used the metro to get in and around dc.  the hotel was welcoming to kids and pets, which was a plus for many people.  overall, i would stay here again."
the hotel is lovely and the door men are very friendly! i cannot say the same for the staff at the front desk. they make it obvious that they really don't care that much about the guests
book it now! a perfect hotel. walk to shops and dinner. enjoy you visit to old town.
"the monaco is a great hotel. i have stayed there many times, and without problem, however this trip i had extremely limited hot water at both the sink and the shower. this was the case both at check in and the next morning. for this reason i can""t give them a top rating this time."
love old town!  so much activity and great restaurants.
"great location, nice amenities, friendly and efficient staff"
the hotel monaco was very comfortable and within easy walking distance of restaurants and sightseeing.
the hotel was excellent - the rooms are large and clean and the staff was very accomidating. the hotel bar could probably use an upgrade - but it works.
shame the pool was closed at a time it was advertised as open.
we booked online without knowing the location. we couldn't have picked a better/friendly place if we had been there in person making a choice.
"not aware of expedia vip perks, shower was luke warm at the most, restaurant mediocre.just not my place. always love kimptons, just not this one."
"overall nice hotel. staff could use improvement. prices are on the high side. underground parking garage is convenient for old town, alexandria."
"staff was very friendly- from the doormen, to the front desk to housekeeping. great location- wouldn't stay anywhere else when i come to old town again. located right in the heart of it all. rooms were beautiful, had no complaints."
"the bathroom was nice and large with a good shower. the toilet was not close to the bed as some other hotels tend to be (pet peeve of mine). for the price, i would expect a larger living space but it was spacious enough."
"this trip was my mother's first to our nation's capital. staying in alexandria, at the hotel monaco, was the highlight of our trip. it was so luxurious and comfortable that she did not want to leave. after a day of sight seeing we ended up picking up dinner 2 of the 3 nights that we were there and ate in the room! it was lovely."
the hotel was spotless and the staff warm and inviting. every effort was made to insure our comfort. parking was reasonable as well.
"hotel is weiil located on king .st. where a free trolley operates most of the day. very good restaurants, especially le madeleine, close by and the waterfront is within easy walking distance. trolley run to the king st. metro which connects to the dc and surrounding area. there is a courtesy van that will pickup and take you to the reagan airport (dca) which was not advertised. use it. we will stay there again."
very nice upscale hotel right in the heart of old town.
"we had a great time here. staff was very courteous and helpful.  it's a fun yet chic atmosphere; they serve wine from 5 to 6 every evening in the lobby.  the metro is about a mile on king street, an easy walk, and then visited the sites of washington from there.  the only annoyance was that the room key card lost its charge several times, so that needed recharging or a new key card.  the staff was cheerful dealing with that issue, however.  highly recommend, especially if you get a good price, like i did, on expedia.  $110 a night."
"great location with lots of shopping/restaurants in walking distance. easy to get to the metro train station to go anywhere else.was disappointed as i don't think the monaco was up to the same standard as other kimpton properties. the walls are very thin and you can easily hear conversations in the next room. housekeeping failed to refresh toiletries, requiring a call at 4 am to get shampoo. won't be returning to this one unfortunately."
"it was very nice but the room [...] were not happy about the parking our only option was valet, there was no street parking unless you drove around searching and then u have to pay for the meter anyway.  [...]  overall the hotel was nice but the bed was not what we were excpecting."
"this hotel was so classy, stylish, and fun to stay at. the had free coffee in the lobby, which is a beautiful place to sit and plan your day. the room was also so well decorated and plush, with a big desk. the pool is indoors and it's like a greenhouse in there. the pool is also very small. the metro is a good mile walk, but everything else is right there including a nice french bistro we ate breakfast at every day, and a short 5 or 6 minutes to the water. i wish they had more kimpton hotels-- i would definitely stay again."
as a native alexanrian i wanted to return to my home town and experience the best time possible to see my city as i did not see it when i lived there. the hotel monaco and the old towne area was the best choice to make my return home more than memorable.
loved the hotel. very comfortable. right in the heart of old town with all its great restaurants and shops. we loved the wine from 5-6pm everyday in the lobby. very classy.
stayed for a high school rivalry football game and enjoyed the hotel location and the bar jackson 20
"- check-in was 1.5 hours after 3 p.m. listed time because rooms were not cleaned.- front desk had me down for king bed, when i had specifically requested two doubles. that was fixed.- front desk promised to call cell when room was ready; never did. had to"
"helpful staff, wine reception each night, nice design in hotel and rooms. very central to old town you can walk everywhere. parking a bit steep, you can park cheaper in nearby garages. nice lobby to sit and meet in. i would recommend."
"in the midst of a heat wave, the air con system was either blasting cold air or very hot air. otherwise, the hotel was excellent and service above par."
"great location, great room, great service! close to dc with a beautiful drive to the city. lots of neat shops and a block away from starbucks. would love to stay again."
the room was nice but i paid thru your website abd then they charged me for my room also . double check before you check out
"great location. amazing staff. room was nicely decorated. bed could have been a little firmer but that's subjective. (as with most cities, you can find cheaper parking around the corner.) i choose kimpton every time given the opportunity. the rooms are consistently spotless and charmingly decorated with friendly, helpful employees. we even got a little welcome kit for my travel partner, my dog. did i mention, i love kimpton?"
"first time staying in alexandria, hotel location was perfect, only drawback was free trolley did not run early in the morning so the walk down to the metro was long"
"great accomodations in the heart of old town alexandria. whether your heading to the capitol or looking to check out some local history the hotel momaco is in the heart of the action. great service, spacious rooms and a special location in the heart of old towne."
"we just had one night at this hotel, so we were very disappointed to find out the free airport shuttle didn't start until 7am.  we changed from another kimpton property because of the shuttle.  we could've taken the metro if we stayed at the other kimpton.  i just felt like it was a bit of false advertising by expedia at the hotel monaco.  this was a $20 error, and the hotel couldn't do anything to make it right.  is there anything expedia is willing to do to earn our business in the future?  we will be travelling a lot to the east coast now that our son is in school there.  please let us know."
"the staff was great,very friendly! get a suite with the fuji soaking tub! the girlfriend and i stayed here for a romantic get away. the suite with the fuji soaking tub was a bit pricey but well worth it! will def stay here again!! walking distance to some good restaurants. if you can't park in the front of the hotel for valt, circle around to pitt street for their garage entrance. tthere's another entrance to the hotel as well!"
i booked three rooms for 7 cousins for our annual get-together.  we almost cancelled because of an impending hurricane but were so glad we braved the rain.  when we arrived we were given rooms on the 6th floor where there was a leak.  we requested and soon got rooms on the second floor.  we had a lovely time and really enjoyed the wine reception each day.  we used the restaurant for a lavish breakfasts and brunch.  the staff was super efficient and friendly and booked us restaurant reservations that i could not get on my own.  i have stayed at the monaco several times before and because i always had a great time i recommended that we have our annual visit there.  no one was disappointed!
"exceptional location. luxurious hotel, near shops and restaurants, easy transport with free rides to main street and accessible to public transport. tourist spots near the area. guest service was exceptional. hotel offered free use of gym and pool besides a beautiful place to go jogging outside."
it was a beautiful weekend with beautiful christmas decorations.
"our 2nd time at this hotel in the heart of historic alexandria. staff is welcoming and knowledgable and check-in was a breeze. the 5-6 pm happy hour in the lobby is clearly a big draw as it was packed with enthusiastic wine drinkers, several with their dogs who are welcomed at the hotel.valet parking is available or you can self park in the underground garage which we did. however the validated ticket didn't work and we had to pay to get out. there is a $29 per day parking charge but the staff were quick to override the charge given our difficulty.highly recommend this hotel."
nice change from the big chain hotels--i enjoy hyatt and starwood chain...but i decided to book at kimpton hotel ---excellent staff and location.  great service from the staff with free van service from the reagan airport and metro.  it is easy to get to the airport and on metro into dc.  highly recommended!!!!
"my husband and i stayed here for 5 nights and were very pleased with the hotel and staff and the location was perfect. we flew in and didn't rent a car so we walked everywhere we wanted to go and it was great. it's close to the harbour, shopping and lots of restaurants and historic attractions. if you aren't into walking the free shuttle runs on king street and is very easy to access. they have free pick up at the airport and also for your return. no in room coffee which i missed but coffee and teas available in the lobby every morning which was nice and a wine reception in the afternoon. if we ever go back to alexandria we wouldn't stay anywhere else."
had two days of meetings in the immediate are and this hotel was located within walking distance to the meetings. room was nice but hallway smelled like a wet dog...lots of rain in the region so could be understandable until i saw someone with a dog sitting in the lobby. i am not a pet owner but do understand that those who are sometimes forget about all the paying (nearly $300 a night) customers with pet allergies who have to stay in a hotel that apparently allows pets. just need to keep a lower profile and keep them out of the public areas.
"i booked a room with the understanding that the bathroom would have the tub that was pictured online. this was not the case at all. tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the pool it was closed. the heater in the room was so loud turning on and off it woke me up throughout the night. i feel as if i was way over charged for what i got. i went there for a romantic get away and ended up walking away feeling like i could have gone somewhere else and got a better deal, with better service, and had the services i paid for but never recieved (such as the pool and the big bathroom i saw online)available to me."
we've been to alexandria many times but have never stayed at the hotel monaco until this stay but will make it our first hotel choice - what a wonderful hotel with a great staff
"super friendly and helpful staff! only complaint is about the wine reception. same wine each night, with one addition from time to time, and only snack was mixed nuts. also, was in the crowded, cold (december) lobby. would have been better held in one of the meeting rooms. if you don't care about a free glass of wine, this place is great! i do recommend it. the best location and service!"
"nice hotel located in the heart of old town alexandria.  great location for walking with many restaurants and bars a short walk away.  hotel service has always been top notch, have stayed here several times for business trips.  great for families, and close to metro to dc and dca."
"perfect. right in the heart of king street, near shops, restaurants, walked from metro, to waterfront many, many times during stay. dc was not far by metro ride, staff at hotel very helpful. i have to say, the service and room contributed to the overall positive experience. when we came home we even went to buy new pillows because the ones in our room were so comfortable! the best sleep we had."
"i booked for 2 nights, but decided to stay for another 4. alexandria is a lovely place and the monaco is in a great location in the old town, and close to the free trolley to king street metro station, so you can also get into dc easily. the staff were friendly and helpful, and the room was stylish and comfortable. no tea/coffee maker, but they will provide one on request. i will definitely stay there again the next time i visit alexandria."
"it took, receptionist almost an hour to allow me to check in. it appeared to be a combination of unfamiliarity, apathy and unwillingness to take action. this tainted this hotel experience very unpleasant. this is not hotels.com fault but with the monaco hotel reception staff.i had to contact hotels.com inorder to persuade hotel monaco staff to provide me a room which i had already paid. it was late at night, it took far too long and was very frustrating."
"pretty hotel, good location, but not what i was expecting. climate control fan was extremely noisy. temperature was either very cold when fan not running or extremely hot when it was. the view was a brick wall!!the shower pressure was very weak and the shower head had one position- facing straight down, making it difficult to shower. dissapointing!"
"i attended a conference in national harbor, md but my wife and i preferred to stay in old town because we love king st. and my wife could also use the metro from there for sightseeing.  we've stayed at other kimpton hotels and this one measured up with excellence all around.  friendly staff, clean, and tastefully decorated.  coffee and hot chocolate on the weekend were a hit.  la madeleine next door to the hotel was a great breakfast spot.  we also enjoyed chadwick's for dinner- a short walk down to the water."
great location with excellent restaurant. beds are quite firm.
"from its eclectic décor to its impeccable service, the monaco offers a fantastic getaway in the heart of old town alexandria. i stayed for a birthday weekend & had a wonderful time. the bedding was incredibly comfortable, the amenities were well appointed, & the service was excellent. i highly recommend the monaco."
"despite being given a one-hour extended check-out time of 1:00 pm, housekeeping began showing up at 10:00 am in an effort to have me vacate my room. after their fifth visit, and many explanations about how the front desk authorized my late check-out, i left at 11:15 am (45 minutes before actual check-out time). i was unable to complete my work for my meetings, and left shaken and annoyed. the desk clerk seemed uninterested in my situation. what started out as a pleasurable experience, ended very differently."
this was my second time to stay at the hotel monaco.  it is in an ideal location.  very easy to get to and from reagan airport via the free shuttle offered by the hotel.  staff was very friendly and helpful.  location in the heart of old town is ideal.
my husband and i recently stayed at the hotel monaco with our 18 month son. we had a great experience. the whole staff was wonderful from the shuttle driver to the desk staff. we had the shuttle pick us up from the airport and they were pretty prompt. the staff had a crib set up in our room within 10 minutes of our arrival. everyone was extremely friendly to our son which i was grateful for. we did experience the warm temperatures in the hallway but the lobby temperature was pleasent. on the 3rd night of our stay our ac broke in our room (and there was a loud party in the room next to ours). we called the front desk and they switched rooms for us pretty quickly. they even gave my son some toys to play with while we packed and did the swap. the location is amazing. great restaurants around and plently of places to walk to. the hotel is not within comfortable walking distance to the metro but there is a free trolley that runs from the waterfront to the metro every 15 minutes. the trolley picks up a block from the hotel and runs from 10 to 10. overall we had a great stay!
"overall this is a great hotel, in a terrific location. very easy to find. the room was spacious and well appointed. the wireless access was easy and very fast. my only complaints were the in-room iron was in very poor shape and the bathtub / shower tap had a continuous trickle of water unless you turned the knob slightly over toward the ""on"" position, which is obviously counter-intuitive. in the spirit of full disclosure, i did not bring this up with anyone until i was checking out. i was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings. my other negative was - while i was toweling off after my morning shower, i noticed a long strand of dark hair hanging off my shoulder. this was a bit gross as it clearly wasn't mine - i am pretty much bald with only a bit of ""peach-fuzz"" on the sides, which is mostly grey. it clearly must have come off the towel, which makes you wonder a bit about their laundry regime. although, it could also have come off the cleaning staff when they were replacing the towels in the room. either way a little ""icky"" from my perspective. however, when i brought the iron and bath tap issue up with the front desk attendant at check-out he was very apologetic and ""comped"" me a night of valet parking."
our stay at this hotel was positive all round and if we visited dc in the future we'd be happy to return to the hotel monaco.
"usually i love kimpton hotels, and even this one, but this time not so much. i was fragrance - bombed on 2nd floor. new room had iron that spit soot. i asked for an ionizer, and got a humidifier."
"the hotel was intimately nestled in the heart of old town. there was access to shops and restaurants all within walking distance. the hotel had a warm ""old town"" feel along with an eclectic atmosphere. the staff was ready and willing to help with whatever we needed. our room had robes and a chaise by the window that i thoroughly enjoyed relaxing in. i would highly recommend this hotel."
my family enjoyed our stay - great location in the heart of old town.only complaint was the $14.99 per day for wifi.
we got off to a rough start when we were given incorrect directions to the hotel's parking facilities...twice.
"we return to this hotel now every year; great vibe, lobby area is always filled with friendly people, kids, dogs, and complimentary coffee/tea or wine in afternoon.  location can't be beat; near great restaurants and walking; across street from a saturday farmer's market which is terrific."
"wonderful hotel in a great location. the eclectic and stylish kimpton decor is a treat, both in the room and in public areas. immaculately clean. attentive staff.location is unexpectedly fantastic. king street alexandria can be toured on foot end to end, full of boutiques and restaurants. alexandria has historic homes and the riverfront parks, plus the running/cycle path from dc to mount vernon runs right through it.also worth noting is you are in dc in 15 mins by car, or you can take the free shuttle down king street to the metro.the only minor complain is a noisy ac in the room, and thats nitpicking really."
"i only stayed there a night, but found everything to be very comfortable. i am not completely sold on the ""discovering your wild side"" theme. i prefer white robes over robes with animal prints. but after i got over the animal print, i found the robe very comforatable. i enjoyed my moring walk to the uspto down king street, which took me about 15 (fast ny walking) minutes."
whether you're on vacation or just having a quiet night in the city the monaco is by far the best choice. we were greeted immediately by the valet and escorted to the front desk and even introduced to the entire staff working the front desk! the staff on hand is second to none and well worth the price of a night or even a week's stay.
"just stayed one night, but was very impressed. literally nothing bad to say. the perfect little boutique hotel."
"hotel in heart of olde town. easy walking to great food, shops and water taxi's. the indoor pool has short hours."
"comfy room, nice price, in the center of everything. overnight parking $24...a bit steep, but service was impeccable."
great clean nicely designed rooms. parking is not included!! $27/night
"i always enjoy staying at hotel monaco at alexandria. staff never fail to greet you at the door or at the hall way. it's very accessible as it is located at king's st. where you can just walk out the door, get coffee, or grab something to eat. the beds are very comfortable and clean. bathroom is very clean! the only thing that kind of got in my nerves is parking. they do not offer free parking! as far as i remember, you will have to pay 10 dollars a day for internet access."
"from the moment we entered the doors, it was a terrific experience. the decor is very warm and eclectic. not at all like the typical sterile hotel lobby. the fire was burning in the fireplace and the furniture is bright and modern and warm all at the same time. the valet service was perfect; they remembered us and my car was outside without a wait, even though the hotel was totally booked. i mentioned that we were celebrating my mother's birthday when we checked in. when we returned from an outing there was a bottle of wine and a chocolate dessert waiting for us. it was the most personal experience i have had in a long time and i travel extensively. the location is perfect for eating, shopping and access to the metro, if you are interested in touring dc."
"there was a wedding reception right under our room that was extremely loud.  many other guests complained, and lasted into the evening.  housekeeping was a joke.  they didn't vacuum or pick up trash or towels in the room; bathroom cleaning was minimal.  they also knocked on the door and opened it even though the ""do not disturb"" notice was hanging on the door."
"was in town for business and this was the first time i stayed here.  the woman as the desk was very professional and personal. the room was bigger than expected and comfortable. next time i'm in town, i will be trying to stay here."
we really enjoyed this two night getaway. we loved the comfort and location. terrific restaurants and shopping.
"wonderful hotel in a great location , heart of old town . friendly helpful staff , very comfy rooms .. would definately stay again."
"this is our second time staying at this hotel, and plan to do so again. this is a lovely hotel, fun without being ""over the top"". service is excellent, location can't be beat. rooms are spacious, very comfortable, love the bathrooms too!"
great location. staff friendly and helpful. lovely wine hour every evening.
"we knew nothing about this hotel but what a find it is! the location is in the heart of old town alexandria, beautifully decorated, friendly and helpful staff, a bustling bar, and just a really happy place to be. from now on, when we are in alexandria we will stay nowhere other than the monaco."
"terrible place to drive to. no on-street or close parking. front desk gal couldn't find my reservation, but luckily the manager or whoever was close by and he was able to find it. bathroom faucet handle loose and wobbling all over. i should have read more about room. no in-room coffee pot and shuttle to airport didn't start until 7 a.m., causing me to have to take an additional cab. not some place i would stay again, but ok. i give it a 3,"
great one night stay. staff was very friendly and the hotel was very nice. highly recommend .
"this is a high quality hotel, comfortable, clean with great rooms and sometimes surprising details (leopard skin bath robes!) that make it worth coming back to. add to that the location in cute old alexandria and the fact that dc proper is within easy reach as are some great walks down the river and you've got a winner."
"the staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. the room wasn't cheap, by was more than i expected. it was incredibley easy to come in for reagan international, as long as its not during rush hour. i would recommend the hotel and plan to stay there on my next trip to northern virginia.additionally, the restaurant, jackson 20, was great!"
"one night, good price and good room.  except for the non view it was just fine."
"we were in town for a wedding and wanted to spend some extra time in the area to do some sightseeing around the capitol. this hotel was perfect, close to all kinds of dining options, many little shops to browse through, walking distance to the river and a free trolley car to get easily to the metro station. the staff was always very friendly and helpful. i would go back and stay here again."
i had a great time. the room was beautiful and the staff was courteous and attentive.
"the hotel is old and well kept. i arrived in a snowstorm and was idle (business trip) on my second day due to snow.the staff is wonderful from the valets to the housekeepers!! talk to them all and engage them and they will all brighten your day.if you wish the hotel will send a goldfish to your room!! for children or you to enjoy if you want a pet!it is not the newest hotel in the area but definitely the best. the parking garage is great and i did not have to drive the entire week i was there.stay here and enjoy yourself,"
this hotel provides great service. very clean and staff friendly. we have stayed in the kimpton hotels before and really like them.
"very nice decorated rooms , very freindly staff stayed there already 3 times and will always go back there"
"right in the heart of historic alexandria and just a quick walk to the king street metro station. we were in town to do site seeing of the washington, dc area and found this hotel to be very comfortable and welcoming after a long day of site seeing. there are several wonderful restaurants to choose from within one block of this hotel, so many that it is sometimes hard to pick one. the people of alexandria seem to be quite fond of their dogs as witnessed by the bowls of fresh water put out on the sidewalk by many of the shop owners and even this hotel. the hotel monaco is a ""dog friendly"" establishment and allows you to bring fido with on your stay. i must say that when i spotted a hotel guest with her dog in the lobby while we were checking in i got just a little nervous of what we would find when we got to our room; we were very pleased the cleanliness and decor were both wonderful."
"i love alexandria and this hotel really stands out.  they have exceptional service, from the doorman who is extremely friendly to the room service personnel.  everyone is friendly and nice.  we went as a family and i felt it catered to all types.  there was also a convention going on but you wouldn't even know it from how quiet it was.  they have a shuttle service to the metro which was very convenient, as well as the metro to reagan airport.  we would definitely stay there again."
nice visit. close to everything. eclectic decor but clean and comfortable.
"excellent quality hotel (at a great price!) - beds were comfortable, service was great, and the location right on king street a couple blocks from the harbor."
beautiful town encompasses this hotel. the service is top notch with every staff member smiling constantly. the kids loved the pool and our room.
"this hotel is a great base for old town alexandria. a bit of a hike to the metro(and dc access without a car), but not too far (10min walk or so). the hotel is clean, comfortable, and the price-quality ratio is exceptional. easy access to many restaurants and cafes and the alexandria waterfront. i would definitely stay there again."
"i stayed in room 645, it took a very long time for shower to reach usable temperature. the sink water never warmed up enough to use. the refrigerator in the mini bar produced a high pitched humming sound so loud we had to call maintenance to find the sound and unplug. we needed to iron our clothes before dinner and thought the iron was broke but it was the wall plug that didn't work. we enjoy you hotel and a night out in town but didn't expect to be room inspector we assumed you guys policed yourselves."
"very nice hotel, friendly, wine hour daily, coffee in the lobby each morning, great room (400 sq ft), newly decorated & updated... my problem is the hotel allows dogs... and consequently smells of dog in the elevator, lobby, halls... and you encounter dogs regularly... your choice."
"place had too many animals and i'm allergic to pets...although i did receive a pet free room, there were pets every where in the lobby and elevators. i don't have anything against pets, but i am highly allergic therefore, people with allergies should be considered."
the room was large and comfortable. the service was really friendly. we had a great time.
the hotel monaco is all about details. they do everything well. this hotel is nestled in the perfect spot in old town between shops and the waterfront. every member of the staff was there to help out and did so beautifully. i can't wait to try other hotel monaco location and go back to this one.
"hotel monaco alexandria was a great experience, its location was near anything one could ask for,less than twenty minutes from washington dc. the hotel amenities was great. parking was limited but you can use the valet parking for $20.00 a day."
"excellent location!!!!  only about 10 blocks from the metro station and 4 blocks from riverfront, property surrounded by quaint little shops. staff was helpful and friendly.  only complaints are cold water on third day of stay and food at jackson 20 (adjoining restaurant) was bad and high priced."
hotel monaco is well worth a visit friendly staff. &very helpful too make sure u ask for a king street. view and the third floor is a dog free zone so request this floor if u r not traveling with a pet. great wine reception each nite in lobby and a wonderful restaurant adjacent for brunch or a casual meal. location can't be beat spacious rooms enjoy we did !!!
"was very impressed with the hotel, staff was very helpful. the king st. trolly goes right by the hotel every 15 min. and is free to ride, will take to to the water front or the metro with several stops on the way. there were a lot of dogs in the motel but if i had not seen the dogs i would not have known they were there. very quite and did not have a ""dog"" smell. the restaurant next to the hotel was a bit pricey but the waiter and waitress were very helpful with area information"
would not stay there again. no parking - forced to use valet - had to pay for internet use.
"superb location, good rooms and amenities. not perfect, but a very above average hotel."
"the staff was amazing!!!!  the hallway on the 6th floor had a very musty bad odor, not a good first impression.  the room had an equally musty odor... ick!  i turned the a/c off when i left and came back to a freezing room.  maint came up and changed the batteries on the controller.  i like the $10 spiff for being a karma member:)"
"easy check in and out.  there was to be a friday night happy hour but i could not find it.  housekeeping  came late one day and i was trying to get ready to go out, didn't need them then.  the room was comfortable and quiet, got good sleep.  loved having a door man when i came in with my arms full."
fantastic stay. great/.safe area with lots of restaurants and antique shops (if you're into that sort of thing)... hotel is a 15 min walk from the metro. staff are very helpful and the restaurant next door a good choice for breakfast. there are adequate gym facitlities for a hotel and a decent pool. staff are able to give you good and easy to follow routes for running. there isn't really anything bad to say about this hotel except that it is quite far away from dulles. worth the journey though and would definitely stay there again.
"the manaco is always lovely, but it's starting to show some wear and tear. i stayed one night. the room was very nice and clean, but there was big scratches on the headboard. the showerhead is dated and not great shower pressure. when i pulled the lever on the spout to transfer the water to the shower head, i could pull the entire spout from the wall; and the toilet ran every 30 minutes and woke me up many times at night. i informed the hotel during my check-out, so it could be rectified for the next guest. i stayed one night, last year at this time, and remember having similar ""small"" issues with my room. i think for $325 for one night, i will try another hotel next year."
"my wife and i stayed at hotel monaco to celebrate out wedding anniversary and it was one of the worst hotel experience we have had. do not let the decor fool you. our first room on the 4th floor was like having your bedroom set in a dog kennel, with dog owners leaving their pets unattended in their room while they were dinning and going out. those poor dogs were barking to death and we asked to be moved. with our luck we were put next door to a room with about 10 people drinking and partying loudly until quite late which prompted us to move again. they put us on the 6th floor in a beat up room with its wallpaper coming off. it was not fully furnished compared to the other 2 rooms we saw previously. it had an ikea plastic chair and only one window the size of a basement window with a broken rolling shade (i wish i could attach the pictures i took). to top it off our room was right across the 3 elevators and their lovely bells that rang all night long. we could not sleep without earplugs. no boutique hotel would have rooms facing the elevators. there usually is a hallway design such as no bedroom door would be 10 feet away from the elevators. this is not a boutique hotel, not even close. more like a bad holiday inn."
"we spent 6 nights in mid july and had a second floor room. very clean, quiet and extremely comfortable room. king size bed was very comfortable, large flat screen tv was great,mini bar a plus. double swinging bathroom doors were not ideal in front of vanity sink for in and out movement. grab rails needed in bath/shower area. hotel staff extremely aware of customers daily needs and very courteous to us at all times. pool hours strange 5pm-10pm only no day time use? would definitely recommend staying here and we will be back again."
beautiful location next to the civil court. many convenient stores nearby. from starbucks to walgreens and the like and many restaurants from breakfast bistros to sit down dinners. enjoyed the time spent there.
"within walking distance to restaurants, bars & king street metro.wine reception nice and lobby fireplace great!"
we spent four nights in this hotel whilst touring virginia. first impression was that we didn`t like the dark entrance and wondered what it was hiding! check in was straightforward and we had a comfortable room. our booking said we had free wi-fi but this turned out not to be the case. we soon realised what was being hidden - paw prints and dog hairs. i have never seen so many dogs in a hotel in my life (some really big ones too). we like dogs and are not afraid of them but didn`t like the idea of sharing a luxury? hotel room with one. it rained heavily when we were there and i am afraid there is no getting away from the smell of wet dog! this is the reason i would not recommend this hotel to some of my friends as they are not dog lovers and would simply have left. everything else about the hotel was fine although it was not as nice as the kimpton we stayed in in philadelphia.
"we loved the coziness of this hotel and the location. it has a cvs pharmacy across the street and a starbucks 2 blocks up. some of our favorite resturants close by were gadsby's tavern and the columbus firehouse and for seafood, the fish market.  the fish market has no atmosphere, but the biggest oysters in town. the hotel has a free shuttle to and from the airport and free wine from 5-6.  the staff was helpful and friendly. we would definitely stay again."
to be in the midst of old town stay here! very centrally located overall great place. would stay again if not here at another kimpton property. 11 out of 10!
valet service was unorganized upon our arrival - i had to go find them and then my husband had to drive around the block until they could accommodate us- our room was not ready (even at 5pm when we arrived) - they took our phone number to call us when it was ready and then never called - we called back at 7:30pm. - on one of our days our room was never serviced - took 45 minutes to have someone come and give us clean towels - staff was curt when i called them-- had to extend our stay one night due to weather - was told it was all set when i called from dc but when we got back to the hotel the desk was unaware that we were staying another night - lots of confusion about us having to move to another room or not move as they were doing renovations on our floor. just very unorganized.
we have stayed there before and found it excellent. it rematns our favorite spot because of its location and service
very nice hotel and right in old town. parking is pretty pricey though.
the hotel monaco exemplifies service. this is a must stay and is well worth the money.
"the hotel is in a great location on king st.  walk a few blocks in either direction and there are plenty of restaurants and bars.  it was a short drive into dc. less than 10 minutes to the national harbor and about 20 min with traffic to the national mall. there is also a metro stop nearby the hotel.  the room was spacious and had a nice sized bathroom.  the parking at the hotel was $29, but there is a garage right next door that charges $5 for the day. i would definitely stay again when visiting dc."
"it's right in the middle of olde towne alexandria, which had lots of things to see and do, and a great variety of restaurants (we recommend bertucci's pizza!). a free trolly passes in front of the hotel. our room was fairly large and well decorated. the bed was as comfy as any we've ever slept on. the hotel lobby was a little warm (a/c trouble? eco-friendly policy? our guess is the former.), but the temp was still comfortable, and it is not unheard of for hotel lobbies to be too cold. the in-room a/c unit was a bit noisy, but the kind you can easily tune out. the pool heat wasn't working, which is bad news for an indoor pool. some of these minor issues may have been overcome by the time you read this, so check with the hotel to see if things are back to working order. overall, we enjoyed the hotel and it was worth every cent we paid."
"this hotel was great...walking distance to the metro to get directly into dc, but was an oasis from the big city. plenty of great restaurants and buskers with a side order of haunted buildings!"
"this place was great. the staff should be an example to other hotel staffs when it comes to customer service. close to dining and shopping in a quaint colonial environment, but also a convenient train-ride into the nation's capitol for sightseeing. i truly have no complaints and would stay here over and over."
we were able to stay at a nice hotel and take the train into dc.
it was a wonderful stay.  the bed was so comfortable.  the staff very accommodating.  the car was ready when we left.  very nice.
"this hotel is absolutely beautiful! it is located in a great area for shopping, eating and general fun. the waterfront is only a few blocks away and they provided a shuttle to the metro. i'd definitely stay here again."
received charges from mini bar in hotel that i never touched
"my daughter and i were touring the wash. dc area and we appreciated the charming and historical setting of alexandria. it was nice to be staying outside of the city but with the conviences of being close to the metro and reagan as well as the hotel shuttle service. the monaco is clean, has elegant but fun decor and the support staff very efficent. the only minor complaint would be our room being located across from the elevators which made for constant pinging and people traffic noise."
we had a great time. the hotel was perfectly located. staff was nice. it was great
"wonderfully comfortable, and decorated in magnificent style. highly recommended."
"already a very big kimpton fan so, this one was easy. perfect location in old town. very eclectic as usual. nice room that rivals the ritz."
the hotel is beautiful our stay was fantastic! would highly recommend this hotel!!!
pleased that there was a free shuttle to reagan international airport.
"it was well maintained , but the room size was small for two queen beds. the vallet was a blessing and the staff was extremely nice."
"an ideal hotel for seeing the many sights in dc via free trolley close by and the metro. old alexandria itself offers history, shopping and fine restaurants on the doorstep. the hotels own restaurant, jackson 20, offers a good choice for breakfast and dinner. the service throughout a nine day stay was superb."
staff was extremely friendly...right in the middle of old town.
"stayed sa-tu for the 2013 inauguration. selected the hotel monaco sight-unseen based on user reviews. i'd return again! lovely hotel. clean, comfortable and pet (dog) friendly (even have dog beds & bowls in the room!). doorman, majid, is great and helpful, as we're all the staff. during our stay, had complimentary 'happy hour' daily from 5p-6p. guests can also take the complimentary trolley to king st. metro station, about a mile away. lots of great restaurants & shopping within easy walking distance. loved it!!"
"the hotel is within easy walking distance to old town and there is free king street trolley service to the king street metro, making a subway commute to the sights of dc very easy. easy walking to shops and good restaurants in old town. parking is tight in the hotel garage, so take advantage of the hotel's valet parking (same cost of $24 for 24 hours). the staff is very friendly, professional, and helpful. an added plus is that the hotal is pet-friendly. if you don't bring the dog, make sure you ask for a goldfish when you check in! great place to stay and we will be back!"
"the hotel monaco is well appointed, charming, and the staff is second to none. it is in the perfect location on king street. the pool is great for kids. the rooms are luxurious."
"very friendly staff, great location. a fun place to stay."
"room was roomy, nicely decorated. weekend nightlife made for a lot of noise, but very quiet during the week. really enjoyed the hotel. had lifeguard (?!?) on duty. pool was great, no crowds, but refilled water during stay so was very cold. all in all, would definitely come back and makes us want to use other hotel monaco/kimpton hotels."
"kimpton hotels are fun hotels period. the energy and vibe when you walk in hotel is like no other hotel i���ve ever stayed in except another kimpton. since we were staying over a weekend, the hotel was packed with wedding parties which made the happy hour time very lively.the room was fabulous and not cookie cutter. the robes were almost worth the price of admission! love the d��cor and the staff was very friendly. really enjoyed talking with folks during the happy hour. the only complaint is they really need more space ��� it���s that popular.it���s a pet friendly hotel and we did not travel with a pet. we only saw a few dogs and we never heard a dog when we were in our room. ed did say a flea jumped on is hand in the lobby, but i didn���t have the same experience. as a cat owner, i know the random flea is a fact of life."
"we where very pleased with our hotel and the location. we where within walking distance of the metro, lots and lots of great restaurants, and many historical sites including christ church where president george washington and robert e lee attended. everyone was very helpful. we had a great time."
"the color schemes and patterns from the lobby throughout the hotel were unusual, but well done. i truly enjoyed my stay at the hotel over memorial day weekend. old alexandria was readily available, as was the metro to go into washington. it was great to see all the kids and pets in the lobby, too. my only complaint was that the air conditioner in the room was loud when it kicked on, though very effective."
"we came down to see a local concert for my friends birthday.  new to the city, the hotel monaco was in the perfect location!  i've stayed in philly and baltimore kimpton hotels and this one was my favorite by far."
we had to wait more than 45 minutes for shuttle service. finally took taxithe check out desk service messed up our bill. we had to return to correct. the wrong amount is still pending on credit cardthere was no coffe maker in room and lobby coffee wasn't available until 7:00 am. we were lucky starbucks was near
we were very pleased with the hotel. the location is perfect and the rooms are beautiful. our only complaint about our experience was with the service at the restaurant -- the servers were inattentive and the kitchen very slow.
"i loved how my dog was welcomed. the front desk staff was outstanding. doggie happy hour was great. the maid did not speak english so it was hard to communicate with her, yet she did an outstanding job. the men who opened doors and did the valet parking were obnoxious. they wanted a tip for just opening the door. if i tipped them for every time they got my car and opened a door i would have spent an extra $100. i bought some wine and one of the men kept bugging me to give him a bottle of wine. these men would stand around and talk in their native tongue which i think is rude. i speak their language and they were saying rude things about me and other guests. unacceptable. that said, i would stay here again."
���just fantastic on all fronts���like all kimpton hotels
"the hotel was acceptable and the staff was very respectful and helpful. the restaurant was the best part of the experience--great food, an exceptional waitstaff and fair prices."
"over all nice place.be aware that wifi is abut $10 per day.  (its 2017, most hotels provide free wifi)parking is about $38 per day (self parking).  if you look across the street from the parking garage entrance, you'll see a parking garage for $10 per day."
"fabulous location! very ""hip"" place! loved that it was very dog friendly even though we didn't have ours with us. in the center of everything."
this is a fun hotel in the middle of alexandria. the room was wonderful. overlooked the main street that was lit for the christmas holiday. the beds were comfortable...internet easily available and free...great robes in the room! a zebra robe and a leopard robe! check in was easy and the people at the main desk were very helpful. recommended an amazing french place to eat near by! probably the best meal i've ever had. the free shuttle to the metro stops a block away. walking distance to waterfront art galleries and great eating places. all in all...a really fine few days away.
"my wife and i stayed here for our 1 year wedding anniversary. the hotel is great. loved the staff, location, and comfort of the hotel. the jackson 20 was great for a late night cocktail and brunch. we love the alexandria hotel monaco. they made our anniversary great!"
"great find in alexandria. very modern, eclectic decor and centrally located. if you are looking for something different."
"the hotel monaco in old town alexandria is a great hotel.  very nice. very kimpton! a word to the wise.  do not take a room on the 6th floor, the top floor of the building.   due to the buildings architecture (very colonial, very appropriate for old town) the rooms on the 6th floor were very small and the ceilings were at an angle with a small dormer window.   i felt a little closed in.  they were very helpful and moved me to a room lower down with a little terrace that opened to the hotel's central courtyard.  very nice. also,  take public transportion or taxi's the valet is a little slow and a little pricey."
"this was our first time at the monaco. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. the hotel is only a few blocks from the waterfrtont and king st. is lined with quaint shops.our only complaints were that hotel staff did not, nor does the hotel's website offer options for parking other than the valet parking offered by the hotel (there were 3 parking garages within 2 blocks of the hotel) and the room temperature seemed warm compared to the temperature set on the thermostat--65. that said, all the staff we encountered were superb."
"the staff is chearfull helpfull,house keeping is a bit out of touchalltogether my stay was good and comfortable"
we had such a wonderful time at your lovely hotel!having dogs around made me feel quite at home. the only thing that kept this stay from being perfect was the sound of the elevators thruout the night--we were right across the hall.
"when describing this hotel, one can not ignore the staff. everyone was very helpful and pleasant while helping with directions, recommendations, etc.what a great ""kid-friendly"" place. if visiting, be sure to ask for a goldfish. one is delivered to your room and becomes part of the family for your stay.you can't get a better location: local shops and restaurants within walking distance with a sort walk to the metro station.we plan a return stay!"
"the hotel is tastefully furnished, beds are comfy, staff is exceptional. located in a historical district adds to the ambiance instead of feeling like the hotel district! great french bakery located next door with good coffee and breakfast selections. we are a family of 4, spent 5 nights, and would stay again in a heart beat."
"this is an outstanding hotel.  it has been completely refurbished and the new decor is great.  the location, king street in old town alexandria, provides good proximity to great restaurants and gret local shopping.  this is a great place to stay."
i don't treat myself to fancy hotels often but i decided to do so for a night for my birthday. i could not have been happier. i just wish i had more time to enjoy the hotel. room was immaculate and i loved the d��cor. even took a bath! i will definitely stay here again when i want to splurge a bit.
"convenient, dependable hotel. easy access to the  metro using the alexandria trolley. lots of places to walk, shop, eat, and drink."
overall not bad for the price. decent restaurant freindly staff
"the hotel staff were always helpful and friendly, made us feel cared for. it was close to the waterfront and also having the trolley running up and down king street made it close to anything in the area. a good price for a quality hotel."
always a pleasure. very convenient. well maintained. friendly
the wine tasting in the afternoon was great! wish they sampled and showed off va. wines. cant beat the location for dining or going out for the night. the staff was extremely friendly.
"we stayed for 5 nights long enough to get over first impressions. the location is wonderful. right on king street in old town alexandria, and down close to the harbor. very easy to walk for anything you need. out for a snack or a meal, coffee or bagels, a walk down to the waterfront, a drugstore. and with the king street trolley you can easily get to the metro. the room was spacious and very clean and comfortable and while youwere aware that is is an old building it was hid very well.the lobby and was open and welcoming but in the end the presentation and feel of the ""boutique hotel"" was not for us. there seemed to be a little something that rubbed me the wrong way about things. from the check in where we were told and extra $50 a night would be charged to our credit card for incidentals and would be refunded if we didn't use it. to the ""doormen"" that held open the door and kept talking to each other as you walked thru. then there was the shuttle to the airport that didn't start to 7am so was no use to us. the free wi-fi that you had to sign up as a loyalty member to use (on the longest form i have ever seen) to the dogs barking in the lobby. i like dogs but while a crying baby in a motel is horror story often told we all know the parents are doing what they can but a dog left barking in a room is just rude not cute at all."
good hotel in old town. food is good and the location is great. valet parking a plus.
this hotel is extremely nice. rooms are very comfortable and very clean. would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again!!!!
a great short stay in old town. the pet friendly nature of the hotel added to the charm (even though i didn't bring my dog)
great location in alexandria. very kid and dog friendly. small but lovely indoor swimming pool. eclectic boutique. afternoon wine tasting in the cozy lobby is nice touch. great value. highly recommended.
"okay, you can access wi-fi, but only after becoming a kimpton member, which involves writing a book and giving up substantial amounts of data about yourself. data that is apparently worth about $12.99 to kimpton, since that's what they charge for 24 hours of access. i found it insulting after paying this kind of money for a room, when almost any of the 'lesser' chains would provide it for free. fortunately there are cafes nearby if you don't have a data plan and need to check a flight. valet parking was a disaster- very disorganized and we had to go find our own car after waiting on the sidewalk for a long while."
we rated this stay a 5 because we were very happy but i guess if we had suggestions they would be a small refrigerator in the cabinet..
"room was comfortable, hypo-allergenic pillows were provided upon request, windows open. the lobby is musty and old. there is an adjacent restaurant that is closed during check-in times, partially, with an unimpressive bar. good beer selection, but this is not a place to hangout or people-watch. room service, breakfast, was 30 min late and i had to call to remind them. food was mediocre...clumpy grits, dry eggs, no complementary coffee service unless you go to the lobby."
"i spent 3 nights at the kimpton hotel monaco alexandria while in town for a conference. i opted for this hotel over the conference hotel because i wanted to stay in an area where i would have more options for meals, shopping, and site seeing. i was very happy with my choice! the location was great for exploring old town alexandria, and for accessing the mount vernon trail for running and biking. my room was very comfortable and included many thoughtful details - plush bathrobe, yoga mat, minibar with a variety of snacks, lots of regular and usb outlets, free wifi. the hotel was in great shape, and i appreciated the free coffee service in the morning and wine happy hour in the afternoon. i was delighted to discover that the hotel has bikes that are free for guests' use - i wish i had been able to use them more than once! my room service breakfast was pricey but delicious and arrived exactly when ordered. and i was delighted to receive a surprise from the hotel one afternoon - a bottle of wine and a plate of snacks! my only complaint about my stay was the noise from a neighboring room's tv late one night, and this was immediately resolved by a quick call to the front desk. i had heard only good things about kimpton hotels prior to my stay, and now i understand why."
"great hotel, staff and location, unfortunately the first night a water line broke, the fire alarm went off for more than an hour, and the hotel lobby was partially affected by the water, the staff did a great job cleaning the place and finally back to normal.the second night of my stay, another problem with the water lines, this time, i had no heater, and no hot water, in a low 30's weather !again, the staff did what they could, and offered me a refund for one of the nights cost, and whenthey realized that my booking was thru expedia, told me that they were going to settle the refund with you guys directly, please take a note and follow up with them."
"hotel staff were exceptionally professional, helpful and courteous.  enjoyed the morning coffee, afternoon lemonade and the physical fitness facilities. hotel is located in a very rich and diverse area of town, close to the river; as well as to the dc metro line.  the only downside was a very noisy saturday night/sunday morning in our hallway with inconsiderate guests talking very loudly."
"beautiful hotel, great location. loved the free wine in the lobby. room was comfortable and roomy but the bathroom was too small. trying to get ready in the morning required taking turns. no other mirror with an outlet anywhere else in the room. jackson 20, restaurant on site, was fantastic. room service was very slow in the morning."
terrific experience at this hotel. do not eat in the hotel restaurant - service was slow and food was cold.
simply wonderful.  location was great.  that's it!
"the hotel is beautiful, and the staff professional and responsive!"
wasn't attentivegot sick the next daywhen i ask for subtype of compensation for condition manager didn't carefront desk was good and helpful as possible but they couldn't do to much considering management had the last say
"great location in old town alexandria, va. jackson 20 restaurant in the hotel was excellent for dinner."
"when i return to the area i will definitely book here again.  the staff is friendly and efficient, the rooms are great, and there's a nice restaurant attached."
"hotel monaco is a beautifully decorated hotel in the heart of old town.  dog friendly, this hotel met our needs and the best part was the complimentary wine hour."
beautiful hotel with fantastic service! the rooms are perfect and the bed was very comfortable. we had a great stay and will stay here again or at any kimpton hotel in any area we will vacation in. love that you cater to our pets :)
"i requested an early check-in as i was arriving at 0900.  sadly, i wasn't able to get into the room until 1400.  that was the only disappointment with the hotel."
"although a ""chain"", this is the most delightful, whimsical, unique hotels i have seen. the bed and bedding were conducive to a great sleep. there is attention to detail throughout the hotel. we were in alexandria for my husbands surgery for a knee replacement, and when we returned the bell staff were falling over themselves to be of assistance. room service was prompt and delicious. from now on, when traveling, i will make it a point to find a kimpton hotel whenever possible."
"far too expensive . no shampoo in the bathroom. no included breakfast. parking $27.00 night is redicilious , alexandria room taxes $42.00 redicilious,  have stayed in rooms all over the world and for this place is far overpriced."
"we love visiting old town alexandria va and usually stay at another hotel.  however, that hotel was booked so we stayed at the hotel monaco.  loved it!!!!  will be using this hotel for our future stays."
"this boutique hotel was gorgeous. the way it was decorated was so neat! i've stayed in a many hotels but this one was the best! the location was excellent, right in the heart of old town alexandria, you could walk to everything. highly recommend it!! service was excellent as well!"
great little escape a short metro ride from d.c. loved alexandria. very fiendly staff. good food at jefferson 20(restaurant next to hotel).
"check in was a breeze, room a/c was running so it wasn't the typical stuffy room upon entry."
"overall, it was worth it; however, they really do allow dogs and there were lots of them. they only have one floor that is dog free and all rooms were taken on that floor. we had two dogs barking on our floor and after complaining over a 2-3 hour period, one of the families checked out. the hotel did offer to move us and gave us coupons for continental breakfast but again, we were going to a floor that might have dogs. we stayed in our original room and it all worked out by about 9 pm, but then i was freaked out that dogs had stayed in our room before, peeing, jumping on beds etc. i have dogs, i know dogs, it's just odd that such a nice hotel is also 'the dog' hotel."
"this was our second time staying at this hotel. great location, great staff, wonderful, comfortable room."
"beautiful hotel, exceeded my expectations...would recommend to anyone."
"we arrived at hotel 1 hour before check-in and got into our room right away, which was great after a 7 hour drive. the room was perfect, comfy bed, nice bathrooms, fluffy pillows.  nice!"
second stay at hotel monaco. i think it's now my regular!
"my only complaint: newspapers showed up at everyone else's door in the morning except ours. when i asked why we hadn't received it, they said you only needed to ask. of course, i didn't know to ask because it was never offered. otherwise, great hotel."
my girlfriend and i had traveled for two days straight and wanted to treat her to a nice hotel. hotel monaco accommodated us in every way imaginable and made our stay one of the most memorable in our lives.
"perfectly located in center of old town alexandria, convenient to many shopping and dining options. hotel was quiet and well maintained, staff was professional and friendly and bed was very comfortable."
"everything about the hotel was so fantastic!! the decor was so unique and eclectic....and coming from l.a. it was like being at home! the staff were incredibly helpful...i was able to check in early, i ran out of toothpaste and they were nice enough to run some up to my room for me in a matter of minutes. the very best thing about the hotel monaco was the location, location, location!! it is centered right in hub of all the action in beautiful old town alexandria. it was perfect and i would definately stay there again!!"
"close to the waterfront, but still only a 15 minute walk to the metro, hotel monaco is well situated for exploring alexandria and dc. our rooms on the 6th floor weren't large, but were well appointed and decorated, with a large well-stocked bathroom. we were on the quiet back of the hotel, although we could slightly hear weddings taking place in the courtyard below. a second upholstered chair (there was one plus a desk chair), would have been nice. the room was quite clean. service was helpful and unobtrusive. you can save on parking if you park under the building across the street to the north instead of using the valet."
"hotel looks nice, lobby staff are pleasant. very difficult to pull up to front of hotel; only a few spots and double parking is necessary. the garage was difficult to navigate my suv in to so i ended paying for valet not to deal with it. i ordered hot water for tea one night and after 1.5 hours it never came and i canceled the order. the restaurant staff was very nice however my shrimp and grits was greasy and my collard greens were gritty. my breakfast room service was fine. great location for stores, restaurants, walking around."
staff was very friendly and helpful. hotel is only minutes to mt. vernon. parking was especially helpful.
"very clean and well appointed rooms with nice amenities. i no longer have a pet, but enjoyed seeing that pets are welcome. i would stay here again!"
"wonderful stay, great staff, convenient location, nice happy hour, beautiful accommodations.  we'll be back!"
"we were extremely happy with our stay. the service was outstanding, and the room was comfortable. we enjoyed the complimentary wine service in the afternoon. the hotel is close to the metro, with a free shuttle ride to the metro station, which made it easy to visit national monuments/places. we will definitely return."
great breakfast close to sights and good shopping and restaurants
"the leopard print boxers and pajamas on sale in the closet was a little creepy, but my overall experience was just ok."
"my stay at the kimpton monaco alexandria was awful. first of all, the hotel staff did not give out accurate information regarding parking and what fees would be charged. they told my husband one price and told me another. on top of that, they charged us for parking on an individual daily basis and a nightly basis so we got charged double. when i spoke with the front desk they said that it was 'just the way it works'. absolutely horrible. the front desk assigned another couple to the room we were staying in so me and my husband were in bed when additional guests barged in our room, using keys that they got from the front desk! the room looks nothing like it does in the pictures. i understand marketing strategies but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online. do not stay here! the hotel staff are awful and inconsistent, the room is not the same as advertised, and you'll be charged an arm and a leg in additional fees."
"love the area! close to shops and restaurants nearby. doormen were very nice and helpful, but theres one girl at front desk can work on her hospitality skills. cute rooms but a bit outdated with some chips here and there. overall i would come back to this hotel!"
very satisfied. convenient to tje water and a short walk to the metro. beautiful neighborhood with lots to see and do. there were huge thunderstorms while we stayed and they were very gracious and accommodating during the ordeal. would definitely stay there again.
"location, location, location. business or pleasure if you are going to d.c. and don't want to deal with d.c., alexandria is the place and this hotel is in the middle of everything. the have valet parking for $27 a day but right next to madeline's(across the street) is a garage that cost $10 a day. everything was clean, staff was helpful. lobby was kind of small but the bar is right next door. complimentary coffee in the a.m. and complimentary wine in the p.m."
just had to get out of town. old alexandria is such fun and the very best place to stay smack in the middle of king st is the monaco.  great big warm fire in lobby.  free wine party every day at 5.  terrific staff and lovely rooms.    one of the areas best indoor heated pools makes this hotel one you hate to leave even for all the fun right outside its doors.
"we had a great stay.  very centrally located in old towne alexandria, a charming southern town!  a little ways from the metro station, but there is a trolley that runs from 10-10 every 15 mins.  it was a lifesaver in the rain!  the staff was wonderful.  the kids loved the pool.  lots of great restaurants and shopping nearby. happy hour every evening.  lots of dogs and very dog-friendly!"
"amazing hotel, amazing staff great areathroughly recommend stay"
second time staying at a kimpton in alexandria. predictably nice and total quality all the way around. staff super helpful and friendly!
there was a dog barking next door. that was only negative. otherwise great hotel
"very comfortable accommodations and well-designed rooms. good value for the room price and location, but we felt nickel-and-dimed by all the add-ons. they charged nearly $30/night for parking, $15/night for a refrigerator in the room (we're traveling with an infant so needed something for milk storage), and another charge (i can't remember how much) for wi-fi access. a truly high-class hotel would never charge extra for a refrigerator in the room or wi-if access. that said, it was still a nice price for the quality of the rooms, the staff was friendly, and we enjoyed our stay very much."
"what a lovely hotel! it's right in the heart of old town alexandria, and close to everything you could possibly want. we walked down to the river, then back up on the next street over to have dinner at gadsby's tavern, which was amazing. the hotel staff are very polite, all have beautiful smiles on their faces, the rooms are lovely and extremely comfortable - overall just a great experience. i would recommend this hotel to anyone."
"we stayed at the monaco for only one night.  located in a quaint area of alexandria with lots of shopping and restaurants within easy walking distance.  the hotel has a parking garage with an entrance conveniently located just around the corner.  not cheap at $29/night and a bit tight in spots, especially for large vehicles such as suvs (we drive a prius).  the staff were excellent and they had a decent fitness room--treadmills, elliptical and stationary bikes.  all-in-all, very happy with our experience."
great hotel with helpful staff in a super location.  a luxurious and fun time!
"very small room, but the location on king street was great. i will bring my own pillow next time as the ones in room were terrible. on an upside very dog friendly and fun wine reception every night."
"i would warn people against this hotel. my reservation was lost and i was put in a cramped, musty smelling room. the hallways were dark and creepy. on top of everything they put a $651 hold on my card even though i had already paid in full when i booked my room. what did they expect me to order six hundred dollars in room service? management was very unhelpful. i was given an email address for the manager instead of a phone number and still have not heard back. save yourself the stress and disappointment and go somewhere else."
the room pillows were dirty the shower faucet was out of the wall. front desk was very rude about me being a kimpton member.
"they overbooked the hotel and did not contact me to help me make other arrangements. i arrive into dc on a late flight, got to the hotel at around 1:00am and was informed that there were no more rooms. they put me in a cab to go to another hotel. not exactly what you are looking forward to at that time in the morning."
"the cleanest, most quiet hotel room ever stayed in.wonderful, would book again."
"we had an unforgettable vacation at hotel monaco. the hotel lobby is so inviting. the gym and pool areas are up to date and clean! our room was so nice, we wished we could have spent more time there. we will be staying there again."
"nice room on top floor, spacious, jackson 20 restaurant good option, all worked well. nobisdues with other guests' noise or pets reported by others. a bit cramped on street in front for loading/unloading but prompt valet."
"we were there for 9 days with our schnauzer and our stay was wonderful from start to finish. i have never seen hotel that is so pet-oriented, and the entire property is bezutiful, comfortable with great food nd. lose proximity to everything! we loved every minute and we're actually sad to leave. all of the staff there be a me friends, and the entire experience e was amazing!"
"great location, good service and unusual decor.  a little surprised to find it a pet friendly hotel and that we were on the doggie floor.  not bad, just not expected.  had we known, we would have asked for the pet free floor but was not aware of that option until check out time."
"extremely limited room service menu for breakfast. terrible service in the restaurant. make you go to the lobby for coffee in the morning. at their wine happy hour, served moscato as the white wine (without a doubt the sweetest white ever). the wallpaper in the bathroom almost induced vertigo. tons of light came into the room at night through the door."
your staff was very helpful and efficient....from the doorman/valet to the maintenance man who came to adjust the tv. the location couldn't have been better! we would definitely recommend this hotel to others
"like most kimpton hotels, rooms are very nice, luxurious and colorful- great departure from standard hotel fair. great bathroom w/ white marble although vanity is small. try to get room w/ balcony facing interior courtyard. cant beat old town location, even for access to gaylord convention center or crystal city."
"the location, the service, the hotel - all great! pool area was not crowded, indoor and relaxing. right in the middle of many historical and interesting sites with easy access to others. complimentary shuttle to/from the airport was a plus!"
it was beautifully decorated and in a perfect location!  all night kitchen & door to door was awesome!
"continues to be one of the better value hotels in alexandria. rooms (at least the one we had) clean, comfortable but not expansive. the free wine happy hour is best skipped for a beer or wine in the neighborhood. skip the mexican food on king street as well."
hotel monaco is an adorable hotel. we loved everything about it from the decor to the cocktail hour in the afternoon. the only reason we did not rate this property 5 stars is because there was construction going on and we needed to move rooms 3 times. maybe next time we will bring our dog since it is dog friendly!
"very nice hotel, and nicely appointed room and common areas. best location in center of old town. only bug-a-boo was the indifferent check-in. the woman who checked me in failed to mention that the in-room mini bar required a key (available from the front desk), that there was a complimentary wine service in the evening, and that guests were being given a discount in the restaurant. had to find all this out from another guest while in the elevator. otherwise, the staff was very nice and accommodating. rooms are beautifully appointed, but the mattresses are very firm - my preference is for a softer mattress."
"main problem was with air conditioning in the room and the hotel's failure to address the situation properly. when room temp reached 74 degrees (set on 68) i called the front desk. we were assured an engineer would be up immediately. 20 minutes later--i called again. front desk had no record of the first call. by now the room temp was 82 degrees. the front desk assured us the problem would be dealt with. we left for the day and returned 7 pm. the a/c was still not repaired and the front desk had no progress report for us, no update, nothing. our impression was that maybe they were hoping we wouldn't bring up the issue again. we asked for an immediate move to another room and were moved within 20 minutes.second, smaller issue: we were in town to attend a funeral at arlington cemetery. the night before, my son needed his shoes shined. we called the front desk and were told to put the shoes outside our door, and they would be ready in the morning. next morning: shoes had not been touched. when i complained to the front desk, i was told: ""why didn't you bring them down to the desk? that's what you should have done.""bottom line: this is a nicely redecorated hotel in a prime old town alexandria location, but i won't be staying there again."
"pet friendly is one thing. but there were entirely too many large dogs - in the lobby, at the happy hour and in the elevators. if you have allergies, like we do, this is a major problem that we were not prepared for. our room was pet free, but dogs were on the furniture in the lobby and shaking their dander in all the public spaces. the elevators had slobber smell. there has to be a better way to accommodate pet lovers and those who are not. disappointed for sure - we were there for a wedding."
just wished they would have given us 2 queens per room. the doubles was kinda of tight for me & my husband to sleep in one bed while our 2 boys slept in the other and we're average size adults.
"friendly staff, clean rooms and a great location -what else can you ask for?"
excellent ambiance and wonderful courtesy.there were some troubles with the air conditioning. the staff acknowledged that some of the rooms were having problems and after a short attempt to find a similarly priced room without airconditioning issues they finally upgraded us to a better room.hotel restaurant was delicious and service was excellent. the restaurant manager treated us especially well and gave us consideration for a special event we were celebrating.
the alexandria monaco is a lovely and boutique style hotel in a fantastic location. it is close to some of the nicest eateries in d.c. the amenities are of a quality standard and the staff are very helpful & welcoming. the only complaint is that the adjoining restaurant was not of the same quality or price. the menu lacked variety and was over priced in comparison to the other restaurants one block down. we would return in a heatbeat!
"location, room, facilities all great. the surprise was the staff quality. very personable and helpful. our first reaction was this management knows how to accomodate."
great hotel and room. close to everything. great happy hour each evening!
"i got this room through expedia.  the hotel gave me one of the worst rooms they could.  i have stayed there before when i made the reservations directly through the hotel and the room was much better.  this room overlooked the back roof of the hotel, was as far away from the elevator as possible and was very small.  i think the hotel gives the worst rooms to the third party sellers."
"very noisy hotel! dog in the room next to us barked for 7 hours! could not get a belman when we were leaving, we saw them outside the window below! said we had to pay for valet and there was no such charge! week later still holding our money! desk was rushing us thru our check in! cleaning staff actually make noise so you get up in the morning! we wont stay there anymore!"
had a great time with my family.  great for adults and families
the hotel is very nice even though it's older. the rooms are small but beds comfy! it's steps from all kinds of bars and restaurants.
the staff is over the top friendly and supportive. the staffs superior and wonderful attitude makes it a fantastic place i highly recommend..
"wanted a 1 night stay downtown alexandria and found the great rate at this hotel. this location was steps away from old town restaurants and shops. the room was large, immaculate and beautifully decorated. right down to the leopard and zebra striped robes. the staff couldnt have been any nicer! we will definitely go back!!"
the staff was always very friendly.  it was nice to be greeted at the door every time you walked in.  the location was great for getting around alexandria.  the room was large and the plasma tv was very nice.  very comfortable bed.
excellent location for old town alexandria and free town trolley to metro. gorgeous lobby and rooms. very classy.
"loved the decor and the location.  i especially loved that the hotel is pet friendly, and the late check out time.the walls are a little too thin, making it very easy to hear what's going on in the hall while trying to sleep."
this was my first kimpton hotel stay and it was wonderful. the service and staff are really great. i loved the hotel look and decor. also this hotel is right in the middle of great stores and restaurants. i'd stay here again and again next time i'm in the area.
"i needed to hole myself up in a hotel...away from distractions, to get urgent work completed for one of my best clients. i chose old town because i could take a few breaks, do a little shoping, walking, etc.there were a few hiccups over the weekend but the staff took care of everything and i am pleased and very greatful. i would come back to this hotel anytime!"
"i have stayed here before and it is the mid-level of the kimptons in alexandria. perhaps it's an east-coast thing, but i have a problem with guests who think everyone will be as in love with their dog as they are! and i am a dog person.kimpton explains that mr. kimpton loved dogs so they're ""dog friendly"". but, dogs on the leashes at the wine social in the lobby and the yapping in the hall was overly accomodative"
this is my second time staying at this hotel and my sister and i love it.we have come to alexandria for 3 years as a weekend getaway from nyc. this hotel is perfectly located in the heart of town with easy access. the staff are all friendly and helpful. not one complaint!
"the rooms and lobby were beautiful. the staff was very helpfull and very friendly, not at all stuffy. it's in a very nice location, lots of shopping and restaurants. though it is not close to the metro we will definitly return."
"we have stayed at the monaco many times. the staff is welcoming and helpful. the rooms are clean, very well furnished and comfortable. the animal skin patterned robes are fun, and pets are welcomed, not just tolerated. the hotel is in the middle of ""downtown"" alexandria, with all attractions and restaurants in easy walking distance."
"great hotel, central location. super staff and great rooms. restaurant excellent."
"hotel monaco is about 4 blocks from the potomac river. it is about a mile to the metro - going the other way. walking to the metro is too far, so there is either a bus that goes by or a free trolley that goes by about 3 times an hour. hotel monaco is in a very good location - close to the potomac, lots of restaurants and lots of shops. the staff was very helpful."
great stay right on king st. everything was within walking distance. the hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. we stayed for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. the only complaint was that the walls were so thin. we could hear the people next to us and people in the hallways as if they were in the room with us.
"everything about the monaco was great - location, wine happy hour, nice pool, great brunch on new years day."
in the heart of old town alexandria. one of the nicest hotels i have stayed in.
"great location, great atmosphere. a real treat. excellent , clean and stylish rooms. super way to have a family stay with the large loft situation. living area as you walk in and then a staircase up to the king bed. great bath tub. great blue color on the outside of the entry to the side of building. complimentary wine from 5- 6 in the lobby."
"the hotel had a lot of character, was ideally located in a great neighborhood in walking distance to many shops and restaurants. however, it was 13 blocks from the metro train station, but, a straight shot on the public bus. parking is steep at $24 a day, however, metered street parking is available. i would stay there again! the hotel is pet friendly, but the third floor was offered to us as a designated pet-free floor.the hotel restaurant, jackson 20, had a great breakfast menu. the bar was cool, offering many specialty drinks.i would definitely stay here again!"
"excellent location in alexandria, with a lot of good place to walk to. the metro station is a bit far but there's a free trolley on king st. to take you there."
awesome stay. thank u. super dog friendly. don't change a thing...
"very nice hotel in a great location.  easy metro ride to dc. staff was very friendly. we really enjoyed our stay. cost of parking is a bit steep, but that seems to be standard for the area."
"great location, room was wonderful. need to do something about dog smell though. i have dogs but could tell it was pet friendly, and windows didn't open so no way to get fresh air. would stay there again though. convenient to everything."
"we had a wonderful six nights at this hotel monaco.  it had all of the amenities that we wanted during our trip to dc and the staff could have not been more accommodating.  the history of the area was fantastic and the hotel was located right in the middle of so much to see.  i would recommend this to anyone who is traveling to the dc area.  great for families, couples, business travelers, etc.  even dogs joined in on the happy hour fun.  the courtesy and humor of the staff added to the experience.  i can't wait to return!"
we enjoyed the location of this hotel a lot. the decor and overall look and feel of the hotel was great! we really enjoyed the getaway and all the restaurants nearby.
"what a great time. did not know the st patrick's day parade was the weekend we were in dc. fun times, and great lobby. love the wine reception every night!"
"the monaco was a very pleasant surprise. we thought old-style hotel hospitality was dead, but it's not. the room was terrific, the lobby (living room) was comfortable for simply sitting and reading or getting a cup of morning coffee and the staff wasn't just friendly and helpful, they honored the one thing that makes a guest experience great: ""find a way to say yes"". they found a way to help us get around, find great restaurants (theirs is great, too) and simply made the entire work/vacation experience memorable. we will be back."
this is the second time i have stayed this year. the staff is always so kind and efficient. the rooms are made for comfort and i have never had any internet issues. one is steps ways from great eating and shopping venues. highly recommend.
"i stayed at the hotel february 13-16th. the staff was very friendly and courteous. the decor was absolutely divine. i loved the wine hour in the evenings. the king deluxe room i stayed in was very spacious and the bed was ultra comfortable. my room also overlooked the courtyard which was a nice touch. there was a little snafu regarding when i wanted my room cleaned but the manager michael did make sure that the situation was rectified immediately. that was the only hiccup i experienced during my stay. i felt like royalty when i left and entered the hotel. the doorman always greeted me with a smile and welcomed me back to the hotel. i love where the hotel is located in old town. there are so many shops, bars and restaurants no matter if you walk to the right or left. i felt very safe even walking at night. it is a quaint town with lots of charm. i will definitely be staying at hotel monaco again in the very near future. i cannot wait to visit during spring and summer when it is beautiful enough to enjoy a cocktail sitting in the courtyard."
"my daughter got married in alexandria. the hotel monaco is in a great location for restaurants, shopping and sightseeing. all of our guests stayed here, and they all raved about it."
from the moment we pulled in we were treated with personal warmth and we wish we could have booked our whole trip with you. this is not the last time for a kimpton property.
amazing hotel. loved every minute. staff was very helpful and friendly. loved the convienence of courtesy shuttle to and from metro. hope to go back soon and explore more in alexandria.
this was my second stay and i appreciated this hotel even more than before. the location is perfect and within easy walking distance to everything important. there is also a free trolley stop close by if you need to go further. free coffee in the am and wine in the pm-who needs anything more! the pool was also great with a lifeguard which you very rarely find. very upscale feel for the adults and welcoming to kids and dogs as well. it was really great.
my stay was great. i only got to enjoy the hotel for a short time but i plan on staying again when i'm in the area. good location and helpful staff.
"fun, eclectic hotel. the staff is very helpful, but housekeeping was a bit uneven during my five night stay. parking is expensive at $25 day, valet and hectic on the very busy king street.the trade off is that your are in the heart of old town and a short walk to the metro station for trips to d.c."
staff was extremely helpful and went out of their way to make sure we received excellent service. we definitely would stay there again.
"the staff was incredible. i had forgotten to pack some things and they were more than happy to replace them for me. the only problem i had was, you have to look very closely to see that it is a hotel when you are walking by or you will pass it. but when i finally found it they gave me a cold wet towel to cool off with."
"my wife and me enjoyed a great extended weekend getaway.located right on king street, amidst great restaurants, small shops and close to the river front, this hotel was the perfect choice.friendly staffs, spacious comfortable room ... perfect.we hope to return soon :-)"
great hotel right in the center of old town alexandria.  staff is helpful and the facility is wonderful.  things are a little pricey in old town but it is worth it to stay right there.   there is a trolley that will take you throughout the area from the potomac to the king street metro station.   it is also only one stop from reagan airport and a great place to walk and shop and eat.   everything is fabulous!
"location is terrific.check in was fairly easy and quick.room was nice. i got the 2 double bed room.there were a few quirks however. you have to ask for a separate mini-bar key, which i guess is acceptable and may be more common than i experience. also, the pool is open odd hours - for example not before 10am on saturday and sunday and not between 10 and 2 weekdays, and they actually enforce this by not allowing the doors to open. the fitness equipment all worked, with the exception of the televisions attached to them. also, tv advertised pay per view, but they must have changed it so it is not available. and finally, internet of course was expensive. i honestly believe i this day and age that wi-fi should be free."
this was a fantastic hotel. the rooms were very clean and quiet. they accepted our small dog with no fee and we will certainly go back. it was a great location. very impressed.
"we were looking for a fun hotel in an interesting spot to stay in before heading to a wedding in richmond the following day. old town alexandria sounded like a good bet, and the hotel monaco was a great way to stay. the staff was friendly, the room was quiet, and we were given free drinks to compensate for their changing our room type of reservation (which worked just fine for us). we love the funky, yet comfortable, decor of the kimpton hotels. we'll definitely keep this in our book of places to stay for future d.c. adventures that are not business related."
the location and hotel staff were outstanding. the beds were comfortable and the bathroom clean and well laid-out. the only negative was a musty smell in the bedroom area. nowhere else in the hotel did i notice this...only room 615.
the inaugural reception for the rewards program was great fun.
"the hotel was fine and the staff was actually pretty friendly. they got my reservation wrong, though. i booked a queen single bed and they put me in a room with two double beds. i am a big guy so that makes a difference to me. when i requested that they fix the error, the refused saying that they couldn't because a large group was coming in and had the rooms together. i felt like i was not important to the hotel. i would have went to a different hotel, but it was late and i was very tired. other than my feet hanging off the bed, the room was nice. i might go back."
outstanding service and staff began as soon as we stepped into the lobby.  staff super friendly and courteous.  super room.  fantastic room and decore was to die for.  all in all i haven't been so relaxed from a vacation.  i hated to come home!
"so don't book if you hate dogs. good service, good rooms and great alexadria location"
"very solid experience, room good, facilities good. staff feel a little more impersonal than other kimpton sites but still, basic service standards are good."
"we stayed at this hotel with our two cats. the hotel was very accommodating and we had no problem settling in our room. we noticed several  guests with dogs. the only down side was that even though when we first arrived there were no pet smells, by the time we left a few days later, the hallways had a definite dog sent. not pleasant!"
the hotel monaco is typical of what i've found at every kimpton hotel... excellent service and willingness to go the extra mile. on this recent trip we spent our five year anniversary with monaco and they provided champaign and a room upgrade. just a small example but pretty standard for them. very clean and a great location.
"we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel monaco! having lived in alexandria some years ago, it was fun to go back. staying at the hotel monaco made it even better because we felt like we were in a ""home"" setting yet it was convenient to all the wonderful dc/va attractions. the staff, the accommodations, the location can't be beat. we hope to do it again some day."
"the hotel was very well situated and easy to get to with free parking, free wifi, happy hour and coffee provided at no extra cost. we were also allowed to leave our car parked in their garage after we had checked out"
"the hotel staff were wonderful. my only comment was i booked the hotel for it's airport shuttle and i had an early flight. the first shuttle in theirming is not untilv7:oo am. so i gad to take a cab,"
the hotel in general and room in particular were in very good shape. the staff was well trained and very polite.breakfast in the hotel was very good. the excercise room is quite small and probably not worth the effort for a short stay.they overdo it with the fragrance in the rooms ...i left the window open to help difuse it.
"we stayed at the hotel monaco alexandria may 26th through may 31st. i don't even know where to start. when we checked in, the conceriege asked if we were celebrating anything. when i told him it was our anniversary and my parent's 50th anniversary, he immediately went to get us somthing to drink and toast with. he was wonderful-the rooms were wonderful-the lobby was wonderful. everything was wonderful. well, almost everything. our only problem was the air conditioner in my parent's room. when we notified the front desk, my parent's were moved to a new room immediately. i appreciated the speed at which the problem was addressed. the rooms were lovely, so large and roomy. the bathroom was spotless and equipped with great toiletries, hairdryer, and even q-tips and cotton balls! really fun robes are in all the closets. free wi-fi, huge flat-screen tv, in-room safe, and a beautiful chaise lounge chair. i loved this hotel. i've never stayed in a place where everyone was so incredibly friendly. the location was excellent-cvs pharmacy on the next block-a great restaurant next door-la madeline. the king street trolley was convenient when we were on king street but it was not very timely when we were needing it at the king street metro-it would finally show up but be prepared for a wait. overall, we couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. this is a first rate establishment and we hated to leave."
this is a hip boutique hotel in the alexandria area. pleasant staff and nice amenities.
"although the hotel is in a great location, the room was small.....the distance from the elevator to the room was very long....the room is attractive but the bed is not comfortable and the linen and towels are not of superior quality. there were too few bell people or valets for the car...long waits ensued always. the heating/cooling unit is loud."
"this hotel was simply wonderful. conveniently located - free shuttle to metro - 20 minutes to washington smithsonian stop. great little pool with lifeguard. restaurant was quality food, but a little expensive. many other restaurants nearby. overall, i would recommend hotel monaco alexandria."
"from orbitz i learned and was prepared for the added parking garage charge. when asked about an additional night's stay, i was informed that it would cost me 1 1/2 times what my orbitz rate was. no thank you. coffee was only available between 6-9am in lobby - good thing for starbucks two doors down. no one offered to help us locate any special services. the one desk clerk was effecient but not friendly."
"alexandria is awesome! hotel monaco is in a super location. we were not too happy with the fact that the hotel was supposed to have bikes available, i called on the way there to confirm,i asked at check in if we had to reserve them...oh, they were there and ready. next morning, we were ready to bike to mt vernon, no bikes. when i pushed the issue, i was told that they were broken.after some back and forth, 2 bikes appeared,in bad shape with a soon to be flat tire. free morning coffee is not ready til after 7 and the tea runs out in an hour, you have to request sugar."
this isna great place in the heart of old town alexandria. the adjoining restaurant is also excellent. i loved the decor of the rooms and also found the pet friendliness of the hotel an added bonus even though i did not bring my dog. seemed to attract pretty friendly people.
great place to stay if you want a top rated hotel and are not constrained with price. it is right in the middle of olde town alexandria
"normally when traveling to dc with my boss, he prefers to stay in crystal city since it's closer to where we usually have meetings but i prefer staying in old town alexandria where there are so many pubs, restaurants and shops to walk to when i'm on my time. this time, i chose the hotel monaco to stay at and i was very impressed. the hotel was very nice and clean and perfectly situated. i think the only negative i could find is that the valet's weren't very attentive. when i first pulled up to check in before rushing off to a meeting, i couldn't even get the valet's attention to see if i could leave my car there for a minute although i pulled up right next to him as he was having a conversation with a co-worker and i ended up parking on the street around the corner. other times, the valets also seemed to be too preoccupied to pay attention to their valet lane and for people waiting around to have someone retrieve their cars."
"i've often stayed at kimpton's monaco across the years, or its edgier sister hotel up king street, the lorien. despite the passage of time, monaco still shines and can't be beat as a handsome, convenient anchor for exploring king street and alexandria's charming residential neighborhoods around the corner. the room decor remains pleasingly quirky, the facilities show not a sign of wear & tear and the staff is, as always, wonderfully hospitable."
"everything was great, from front desk to valet to quality and cleanliness of the room. quiet yet right in the middle of everything and just blocks from the water. the adjoining restaurant was really good, too. we only had appetizers and a few cocktails but both were solid. tuna carpaccio was especially good and the oysters were fresh with a great vinegar sauce. a nice night away!"
the staff were great. the took the time to get to know my name and said good morning/evening etc everytime they saw me. loved the personalization.
it was a one night getaway for my boyfriend and myself it was very relaxing
"we had a wonderful stay at the jefferson. we were there for a wedding, and that evening, the bride and groom's champagne and chocolate covered strawberries were accidentally delivered to our room, but when we called room service to inform them of the error, they told us to go ahead and keep them for our trouble and sent the bride and groom a new set. score! the hotel itself is very impressive: marble columns, plush carpet, beautiful details. helpful and courteous staff. we thoroughly enjoyed our experience."
check in was easy. the hotel was very child friendly. the pool hours were extended for the spring break so the kids could enjoy the pool later and they played a movie in the pool area. we had a great trip and would come again.
"first time stop over in alexandria on my way back from picking up my daughter from elon university heading back to long island. it's about half way between. old town was great, hotel's location was awesome, had the best corn beef and cabbage ever at daniel o'connels, although jackson 20 @ the hotel looked great too - probably the busiest restaurant on all of king st and we were hungry and didn't want to wait. hotel lobby, hallways, rooms all we impeccable and gave off such a great vibe. you felt privileged to be a guest there. fabulous place to stay with a dog too. i guess it's pretty obvious that i enjoyed my quick stay here!"
"this was our first time in a kimpton hotel - hotel monaco is a great hotel within a short walk on king st. to the new year's eve fireworks extravaganza on the potomac in alexandria, va. it is a pet friendly hotel - we did not have a pet - so were roomed on a non-pet floor.  however, we could have had a ""goldfish"" if we'd wanted a pet!!!!  they also had a reception in the lobby from 5-6 pm where wines - red, white sparkling were served - don't know if this is a daily event or just because this was new year's eve. it was well attended - nice friendly people."
we visited twice in 12 day holiday. my wife fell in love with it and took lots of interior photos. the first visit was after a flight delay and then problems with the gps/satnav which meant a five hour total delay. we were given tlc at check in and drinks vouchers for their bar restaurant. the food was good and a really nice friday night atmosphere in the restaurant. we rushed off early the next morning. the second visit for two nights was also good. we had a room with a balcony which was unusual for the usa and we enjoyed this opportunity to read and relax on the balcony. another good meal in the restaurant on the second night.
"was told at front desk that only 1 floor was not designated for pets, and it was sold out. my room was on the 2nd floor, dog was left alone, barked, scratch on the door for an hour, before we called the front desk. next day, moved to 3rd, radiator malfunction. front desk told us that it could not be fixed, no refund, because we did not book with them."
"nice hotel with a great location. heating/ac unit in the room was very loud. pet friendly hotel, don't be surprised when you get on the elevator with a tiny person trying to manhandle a doberman."
was there on business.  the only issue we had is that it is $29 per day to park!
everything was terrific about this hotel from the cleanliness of the rooms to the very hip feeling ....... even the bar had attracted the best patrons in the area.i highly recommend!
this is a nice hotel let down a bit by the standards of service. rooms are well equipped and designed and very comfortable. we only used the restaurant once but that meal was as good as we experienced in our stay.there is a a pool which given that temperatures never fell below 30 during our stay was very welcome at the end of the day. it needs some refurbishment and nowhere to shower before using it!the glass of wine available in the lobby for an hour each evening is a nice touch but the accompanying nibbles were poorthe staff are friendly and anxious to help but seemed to have limited knowledge of local facilities. an email enquiry prior to arrival went unanswered and i contacted hotel services 3 times during our stay about other things and on each occasion had to chase them up to get an answer.the hotel is situated at the river end of the long king st and is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities. the metro is a good 15 minute walk to the other end of the street and although there is a free shuttle it does not start until 11amwe enjoyed our stay at the hotel and liked it. alittle bit more attention to detail and it would live up to its own billing
"it was a very nice hotel, looked beautiful outside and inside, very clean, very friendly, they had morning coffee in the lobby and in the afternoon wine and tea. the location was awesome, since there is lot's to do in old town alexandria plus it is close to airport and washington dc. i will truly recommend it!!! oh by the way they also had 24 hour room service :o)"
2nd stay in a month and it was an easy choice for visits to the greater dc area.  love it.
"our stay was wonderful. i cannot say enough things about how great the hotel staff were. comfortable, well decorated rooms. must love dogs--lots of dogs throughout the hotel and neighborhood"
"the room was beautiful, but was a bit cold even with adjusting the thermostat. most of the staff were very nice and courteous. hotel decor was great and offered many amenities. the location was nice and there were many restaurants, stores, and other attractions available for one to investigate and enjoy. check-in and check-out were smooth with no problems. would definitely stay again, for a longer period of time. great hotel!"
"excellent room. one caveat: avoid a room on the ""dog park"" side of the hotel. it's really a wide alley between two buildings that's set up with tables and chairs for people to hang out. lots of barking from their dogs till 8:00 pm. parking's a bit expensive at $25 in their garage. no vouchers. i asked."
"we chose this hotel due to location, and because we had been here previously for one night; we stayed several days this time. location can't be beat. room amenities are excellent. bed was a little hard. staffers are very nice, but they seem to need more. front doormen seemed more interested in chatting with each other than serving guests but once you got their attention, they could be helpful. if you stay here, you must love dogs. the hotel is overrun with guests' dogs who are all generally well-behaved, but they are everywhere. we knew the hotel was dog-friendly but it was rather overwhelming. we will stay here again, but at a time when there are fewer families likely to be traveling (hence, fewer dogs)."
the service staff were fabulous- wine reception held every night in the libby- excellent location in the heart of old town. very clean! great decor!
staff was friendly and helpful. room was comfortable and quiet. parking at hotel is a bit pricey.
this is an awesome hotel.  very convenient to public transportation and the waterfront.  the hotel is beautiful and the staff was amazing.
had a great time hotel was perfect. everyone was very nice
would stay here everytime while in dc opn business or pleasure
"the weekend we stayed experienced warmer than usual tempertures.  we turned the heat off and it was still too hot in the room.   i guess the air was turned off for the season.  we didn't ask the staff for assistance because we were just too tired to deal with it after spending the day at a family wedding. luckily, we were able to open the windows and it was much better.  aside for this issue, the hotel is great, the service is great and the location is fabulous!   i would stay there again on my next visit to va."
room was very clean and well appointed. the wine reception each night was wonderful and the wine was very good. unique place to stay and so easy to commute into dc for sightseeing. local restaurants were excellent.
"hotel is very nice and walking distance to restaurants, bars and shops. staff was very helpful as well. walls are thin so it can be very noisy if people are talking in the hall or their rooms. that said, i would stay there again if i was in alexandria."
the hotel room was gorgeous! i could not have been happier and can't wait to stay there again!
a great place to stay within walking distance of excellent restaurants and fabulous shopping.  the staff is courteous and efficient.
the personnel are quite helpful and they are not understaffed so promptness is also a plus. location is great with many restaurants within walking distance. i did not eat in the restaurant within the hotel so i cannot comment. overall a quality hotel in a nice location with very good staff.
"this is a very comfortable hotel in the heart of old town alexandria. location was perfect, w/i blocks of the potomac river. the accommodations were wonderful, very relaxing. great if you are traveling with a pet."
perfect location for staying in old town.  staff was very nice and helpful.  easy airport shuttle!
i stayed there for 4 days and found a cockroach in my bed on the pillow...
"very nice. staff, room,  and amenities were all excellent."
"we loved it! very clean,attentive staff and centrally located to everything."
have visited this site for many years back when it was a holiday inn.kimpton has upgraded and added their delightful touches in decor.the staff is extremely helpful.very pleased with our stay.
i recently stayed at your hotel with three of my co-workers. we had a wonderful time. the location of the hotel was perfect for shopping. my only advice would be to avoid the hotel's restaurant for breakfast; it was too pricey and the food was just average.
the room and furnishings were beautiful. loved the cozy liveliness of the lobby- nice fireplace!  perfect walking distance to restaurants and waterfront.  we will be back.
"was impressed by the decor, the rooms, the reasonable rates. was not impressed when my air conditioner iced over and stopped working, and the only way to fix was to turn on the heat to melt the ice. when the ice didn't melt all the way, i was advised simply to turn the air conditioner off. not really the best solution in d.c.-area heat. the result was a very uncomfortable night. i would make sure the ac unit in your room is working before you stay here -- but otherwise, my stay was lovely."
"i have stayed in this hotel 3 years in a row. everything about this hotel remains consistant, professional,courteous, clean, friendly...i really can't come up with one thing i don't like about it! it's also the closest hotel to murphy's irish pub...they've never met a stranger and i'm comfortable walking there and back to the hotel alone."
i have stayed at this hotel 3 times. the staff are so friendly and the location is perfect for exploring old town. i have stayed with my 2 daughters from when they were ages 5 to 11 and they love it as well! it's perfect and fun on the holidays.
"the kimpton hotels are fun places to stay; no two places are a like in decor. but the two i've been to (hotel palomar- wash) and hotel monaco had excellent staff service, a nice restaurant, convenience to mass transit and stores."
"i am a long-time va resident and have never had the pleasure of staying here until last dec 2011. i was pleasantly overwhelmed by the staff, the location, the accomodations, the pool area and the nearby shopping! thank you! i desperately want to come back!"
"the hotel is fantastic. clean, well kept, friendly staff, great location really top notch."
the hotel was so clean. my wife is a bit of a germ freak and she just loved it. she loved how clean the bathoom was. didn't see those yellow stained corners in the bathooms! and the towels and bed sheets were actually fresh and clean! i love this hotel!
room was not ready at 3:00 but they did get a room for us. told it was no pet floor but there was a dog next door. guy was smoking on balcony in next room. otherwise it was a friendly staff and an enjoyable stay.
"the a/c unit in our room was extremely loud. if you get the room next to the swimming pool door, run down stairs and ask to have your room changed."
"friendly hotel in a lovely neighborhood. some of the ""deluxe"" rooms are small and anything but deluxe. our first room looked out on a solid brick wall that covered all the windows, making it very dark as well as small."
"interesting location...in the heart of old town alexandria.  surrounded by shops and restauants.   wine tasting in the lobby of hotel.  restaurant connected to hotel.  even though dogs are allowed in the hotel, i did not see any inside, nor did i hear any dogs barking.  excellent robes.  no refrigerator in room...no coffee machine."
"great romantic getaway to the monaco-second time staying here. well-appointed, helpful staff, and pet friendly! there was some water damage to a wall in our room which was surprising."
"didn't like the really high valet parking, and there was no other parking options that i found available."
"it is beautifully decorated, comfortable, and has access to shopping, fine restaurants and other points of interest withing walking distance. there is a free trolley (or free hotel shuttle) to the metro. what a wonderful place!"
"the front desk people did not seem very knowledgeable about nearby restaurants or how to navigate and get to see the dc cherry blossoms. one thought he was a comedian -- not very funny after the first 2 minutes.lots of dogs there (which is nice and welcomed) but i have been to other kimpton hotels where the dogs were more welcomed with treats, beds, named greeting. it was nice at monaco but had better treatment at other kimpton hotels."
it was awesome that the hotel offered complimentary bicycles. we had a most enjoyable bike ride to mt. vernon.
"my children gave me the gift over thanksgiving of staying at hotel monaco, which was lovely . . .with one exception. the staff was excellent: as i am partially disabled, i require certain types of rooms and the hotel accommodated promptly. the room was comfortable and the location of the hotel -- near the center of charming old town alexandria -- could not be better. however, my family and i were disturbed by a race-baiting plaque on the hotel exterior, which we thought very inappropriate for a hotel of the quality of the monaco. when brought to the attention of the hotel staff, they seemed not to know the history of the plaque."
"purpose of the visit was a conference in national harbor.  greeted by a lovely staff who held our bags and got us in to the room in an hour ( way before checkin time!) by calling us at a nearby restaurant.  plus, we were not part of another large wedding group.  loved the room: comfortable bed, shower was great, super clean overall!  location is excellent!  near shops and lots of restaurants, starbucks and cvs right out the door.  not close to metro, so we took cabs to all the sights.  wine for free everyday for one hour where we met many nice people.  well behaved dogs are welcome.   second time with kimpton, and i decided to join their rewards program.  outstanding in every way!"
"if you are going to stay in quaint old town alexandria, this is the place to stay. they have pet friendly rooms, a morning coffee station in the lobby and wine in the evening. the rooms were immaculate and tastefully decorated.if you are not used to city noises, be sure to request a room that is not on the king street side of the building- a trolley pulls up making electronic announcements of the stops all day/evening long. i was on the third floor and could even hear street conversations as people entered and exited the hotel.the pool and fitness room are nice too. be sure to make your requests early- i think this hotel is often fully booked. there is another (?smaller) kimpton hotel around the corner called the morrison house. it was my first stay in a kimpton hotel and it was very pleasant."
"directly out of the golden age, this hotel is exquisite in every detail. it is just lovely and comfortable."
"i enjoyed my stay. the decor was beautiful, the staff was friendly, and the wine hour was really nice!"
"the stay was almost perfect. the night we arrived the jet tub didn't work, but everything else was amazing and they had the tub working by the time we wanted to use it again. highly recommended!!"
"this is a very nice hotel. it was quiet and comfortable. althought old and well worn our room was comfortable. what made our stay memorable was the unfailing warmth, courtesy and consideration of the staff. we felt welcomed and cared for our entire stay."
"this hotel is very nice, well kept, very clean. the rooms are very comfortable, wifi is good. the area has a lot of restaurants and shops around for taking a walk around the area.if you're in the area, this is a great place to stay."
"hotel was fun. great atmosphere for kids and pets but still felt high end. biggest problem was lots of noise, both from street and from passersby in hallway."
the only issues wereloud heating mechanism. room service was a little slow for breakfast.i liked the room decoration and the bed was very comfortable.
"we had asked for a quiet room, far from elevators. this was indeed far from the elevators. the room was small compared to one we had previously and not with the view on the street (which was part of the description when we booked). the view was terrible outside. more importantly, the heating a/c system was super loud and it will wake you up each time it will start again. we were so tired in the morning. the shower was warm and not hot. the staff was quite efficient but ""cold"". altogether, quite disappointing."
the king street location was excellent for getting to all the sites you would like to visit in d.c. blocks away from the potomac. free trolley brings you to the metro station. can't ask for a better location.
we stayed for 2 nights and loved our room and location of the hotel. room had a colonial feel and was roomy. hotel is right on king st in old town alexandria. surrounded by cute shops and easy access to the trolly which goes to the metro. can't wait to stay again!
"this hotel offers a great set of features for visits to alexandria:-> great location on king street, walkable from there to everywhere in old town-> great service - entire staff of hotel very friendly throughout-> nice rooms - comfortable beds, dimmers on all light switches including in the bathroom to adjust the lighting as you like-> dog friendly - if you're traveling with a dog, this place is very dog friendly, including dog amenities at checkin-> evening cocktail hour in lobby - very friendly buzz-> parking garage below hotel - very convenient-> very reasonable rates for the quality of the experiencein sum: a real gem of a place!"
"we went to old town alexandria, va for a short getaway between christmas and new years. had a great time! hotel monaco was awesome! we enjoyed the decor, and christmas decorations. the jackson 20 restaurant was also excellent. we had the best duck dish anywhere (better than chinatown 0 san francisco!). except for a little confusion with our room service breakfast order, everything else went great. the staff are particularly welcoming and friendly, from the front desk, to the valet, bellman, and the waiter. just terrific! we live about 2 hours away, so we'll be back for more visits for sure!"
me and my family enjoed the stay and wish very soon to go back
"it was good. the hotel is in a good location, good staff. i have stayed there before"
"nice boutique hotel in the heart of alexandria. good change from all the ""run of the mill"" chain hotels. location was perfect with many choices for dining, shopping or just taking a stroll in the evening."
only four for cleanliness as shower needs to be hit with a couple of squirts of bleach along the edges and in the corners. otherwise a great stay!
"the old town hotel--a former holiday inn--is undergoing extensive renovations. it still has a great location about four blocks from the river, and the prices are reasonable, but restaurant is closed, only one elevator is operating--i'd wait."
free coffee service in the morning and a wine happy hour were both nice amenities.  parking a bit of a problem.
"we stayed one night and the location was excellent to all things old town alexandria.  overnight parking across the street in public parking was $15 compared to the hotel's valet of $27 or $29, so i recommend parking in the courthouse garage.  staff was very friendly and helpful.  great brunch onsite."
"the air wasnt working well.i had to ask three times for them to come to the room,and work on it. it was very hot like 92 outside."
you can't beat hotel monaco for a night in alexandria. great hotel in a great location!
staff at the desk were incredibly helpful and pleasant.
this was a short & first visit for my husband & i to old town. hotel monaco was a great choice! the room though small was ample. front desk and all employees very friendly and helpful. the wine tasting happy hour was great! location was perfect. we took other reviewers advice and used the parking garage across the street which was half the cost. and the lobby morning coffee was very good too!
"lovely hotel. shuttle service only goes to regan airport not dullas, we had some confusion, but the staff made it up to me. i would stay there again."
"the hotel staff was very polite and the hotel exceptionally well cleaned and maintained. the location is a real plus with a diverse choice of breakfast, lunch and dinner options as well as shopping and entertainment."
room in excellant condition and perfectly cleam. excellant location. the breakfeast is a little bit pricy and does not offer many choices
easy to book; price dropped from time of booking to arrival date. submitted claim and expedia credited difference.hotel was excellent. great location; terrific accommodations; wine service at happy hour is a nice touch prior to dinner plans.would definitely stay again!
"really enjoyed this conveniently located hotel on arguably the best street in alexandria.it might not be as close to the metro as some of the big name hotels but being closer to the waterfront was nice and there's a bevy of fine dining, pubs and such to keep the entire family happy."
"clean room.  lobby was great, and restaurant was outstanding."
"conveniently located in old town alexandria.  style, comfortt, excellent service."
"the hotel location is great and within walking distance to everything. the service was not up to what is expected for a monaco hotel. when we arrived, it was raining and we had to wait out by our car for the valet and bellboy to come out. they weren't busy at all; they were just standing around. on several occasions, there was no one available to open the doors or they were just standing around talking. the first night, we had problems with kids in the swimming pool after midnight making noise and running around. we tried to call downstairs but the room phone didn't work so we had to use our cell phone. after the call was made, the noise stopped after a while. the next morning, the toilet wouldn't flush. we advised the front desk and they fixed the toilet and looked at the room phone. when we mentioned all of this to the person checking us out, they comped us for one night of parking. honestly, we were expecting more than that, but it was a nice gesture. the room was nice but not very big."
"we found the hotel staff very friendly and quick to respond. however, the morning wait staff in the dining room (jackson 20)was generally slow and unattentive. the exception was the hostess."
we spent three nights here and loved the locale and the room but were challenged by the lack of 'in room' tea and coffee facilities. when we asked reception they sent us up a filter coffee machine which made terrible coffee. only a minor point but would have added to our experience to be able to make a cup of tea.
"quaint lovely stay, in an old brick and cobllestone neighborhood. i enoyed my stay with the indoor pool and 24 hour gym. evening wine reception was a treat. (the room is a bit small and there is no jacuzzi) but we survived by the old french decor and amenities. plenty of eateries to choose from and affordable."
business. good spot for meetibgs. monique and front desk staff were fabulous.
"from the first moment, things went very smoothly.  we were upgraded to a suite that was very lovely! unexpected, and very welcome!  the room was clean, beautifully decorated, and comfortable.  we stayed 2 nights.  they have a wine hour with complimentary white or red wine in the lobby.  we would definitely stay again!"
my overall experience was very pleasant! loved the room decor and cleanliness. didn't care for the service of restaurant attached and my son and i ended up leaving after no server for 15 minutes with less than 5 other patrons noted. the construction downstairs resumed in the evening however it did not affect us while we were in our room. i would stay there again!
"really nice, updated and clean. would definitely stay again."
"this is a nice hotel in that the decor is nice, the bathroom and beds are nice and they have free wine every night.  we found the service and management pretty bad.  the manager lied to us saying first they didn't even offer ""queen sized beds"" when we ended up with two doubles instead of the queen and then blamed it was our fault because we booked on expedia.  we looked on their website and saw they did offer queen beds and have availability at the time and we then ended getting a room with a queen since ""they just has a cancellation"".  then we ordered room service, waiting an hour, called back and our order was never even put in.  the girl we had ordered with ""left a long time ago"".  we did get a $25 credit to dine at jackson 20, though.  their food is good and it is a fun atmosphere.  honestly, the kimpton hotels are nice except for the service.  i believe they just have weak management.  we had a brunch for a baptism the same weekend at their other hotel (morrison) and they were clearly understaffed and disorganized.  it was terribly slow and the manager of the food place only had one person taking care of 16 of us (this was a prearranged private booked brunch).  the food was good but it took 20 mins to get everyone their entree when it was a preset menu of choosing from two items  definitely not the fault of the poor guy waiting on us but some problem with the kitchen or management."
"typical brick exterior in old town alexandria, hides a warm inviting lobby with a fireplace, a deep turquoise blue and nicely appointed.  friendly staff greeted me at the door, as well as at the front desk, where i was treated to drinks in the bar.  the d��cor is a bit busy, but fun.  my room was on a nice courtyard, which was closed for the winter.  i loved the d��cor, finish, appointment and comfort of the room.  bed was super nice, bathroom, spacious and marble throughout.  went to the bar for a night cap the first night, and a lively bar scene of patrons in their 30's to 60's, bartender made my custom drink, and i, being alone, enjoyed soaking in the atmosphere, trying to stay off my phone, except to check the hockey scores.  parking garage in the basement was key and convenient.  there was a pool, but i was a bit disappointed there was not a hot tub.  other than that minor disappointment, the staff was super helpful and polite."
"i come back here over and over... because of its perfect location, style, nice staff and cleanliness. cabs waiting in front of the hotel at all times. walking distance to all shops and restaurants, the river and the boats.one thing that puzzles me in all hotels, not only this one is there will never be enough (sometimes even none) soaps, shampoo bottles and sometimes even towels for the number of guests the room is booked for-could it be because they want to save them, or because they want you to call and you have to tip the person that brings them?!another thing-no morning newspaper on the date you are checking out. not biggies - i would not change a hotel because of the above but too petty and goes against hospitality rules."
my favorite and only place i stay when i return to my home town for a visit.
"wonderful! highly recommend. decor is a bit odd, but it works."
"hotel monaco is located in old town, alexandria which is an amazing neighborhood full of many options for dining and shopping. my boyfriend and i stayed here for our two-year anniversary and i actually preferred the time we spent in old town close to our hotel, rather than the time we spent sightseeing. i can't say enough about what a great neighborhood the hotel is in. we stayed in a corner room with a king bed. the room felt much larger than your average hotel room and the decor is very unique. we valet parked our car in the underground garage for two days, which seemed easier than attempting to find parking in the busy neighborhood."
"this hotel is located in the heart of old town alexandria, a block west of the main square and about 4 blocks (maybe a 5 minute walk) from the marina. we booked our room here based on the high ratings and positive reviews on hotels.com and other sites. this hotel definitely deserves its aplomb! its decor is unique and we really liked the look. the king room we had on the fifth floor was very clean and comfortable, and the common areas of the hotel were well maintained and also clean. although we didn't have the kids with us on this stay, the hotel seemed very kid-friendly. we'll definitely stay here next time we're in the area."
the location was perfect. the metro was a little ways up king street but u could take the free trolley although we enjoyed the walk. staff was very friendly. we really enjoyed the wine happy hour.
the bellmen were extremely friendly and acted like they enjoyed their job. hotel was beautiful. across from a french bakery and an irish pub - both with outdoor seating. a great break from the hustle of washington dc.
"we had a lovely stay, location is great and staff especially friendly and helpful. two tiny observations that might help them make everything even better. one, there were no towel rods near the sink, nowhere to put a handtowel. also, unlike every hotel i've stayed in, there was no shower cap.initially i was apprehensive a pet friendly hotel would show signs of pet hair, noise or other things a non-pet family might not tolerate. but the worse things i saw were some very cute dogs behaving extraordinarily well! definitely not a problem."
very nice boutique hotel and great location. rooms very cute
outstanding overall. we felt welcome as a family with a small child even though most guests were on business. very gracious service.
hotel says free airport shuttle but it should note the shuttle is only to and from reagan national not dulles.
we stayes at the monaco as we were running the george washington parkway classic. perfect location. hotel was very clean and decorated nice. comfortable bed. staff was nice. only bad part was they said the garage was full and we had to pay $27 to park our car for less than 24 hours. would definitely stay there again though.
fun wine hour in the lobby..comfy robes..well working bathroom..nice shampoo and soaps.location was good if you like the busy times of old town. quite a long walk to metro.
we had a fabulous week. the wine reception is a special touch and we were able to meet a lot of interesting people during it. employees go out of their way to be nice. very clean and well maintained. perfect location near wonderful restraurants and shops. very safe.e
"loved it. i'd never been to the area before, and the staff were quite helpful and friendly. the hotel is lovely."
"i've stayed a number of times for business and enjoyed my stay. however, during my most recent stay the a/c wasnt working so i called for service...no one ever showed up and finally at 10pm with a meeting in the morning i went to bed- uncomforatble! very dissapointed!"
"would definitely stay again. we really enjoyed the personable staff and the very clean rooms, very impressed on how ""pet-friendly"" everyone was"
"very nice..walls are thin, however..nice courtyard"
"i was greeted very warmly and since i had a late check in i also was greeted with a complementary glass of wine. the staff helped me to my room, held open doors, suggested great local restaurants and were generally awesome."
"my wife and i are always on the lookout for pet friendly hotels, but most often end up staying in poor off-highway motels. the hotel alexandria by kimpton could not be further from that. it's a luxe joint that allows dogs of all sizes for free. the bed puts the westin dream bed to shame. there's complimentary wine happy hour with snacks. a gorgeous pool. the list goes on. you owe it to yourself to stay here!"
the only problem is that the hotel and everything on king street is very expensive.
"when we get there with the door man, with the name majid!, was pretty reluctant to bring out the cart and help us with the luggage. finally, he dragged out the cart and stood there till i filled out the cart. he pushed the cart inside and stood there (like he is waiting for tip, which he did not desrve). i gave him my $2 and he looked as me as if he is just done saving my life through a critical heart surgery and that i am such a jerk i only paid him 2 dollars. he walked away without even saying ""thank you!"". also a night before our departure, we came to an uncleaned room at 5 pm (we left before 9 am for sight seeing and came back super tired), and when i called the front desk, he asked me ""do you want it to be cleaned?!"", me: ""...of course"", and the response was ""no problem, i send someone to clean the room!"", not even an ""i am sorry!"". we have to hang outside in the hall way while it was being cleaned superfast in 5 minutes."
"staff amazing, every single one of them pleasant, eager to please, and make each guest feel special"
swimming pool was not available otherwise it would be a 5
"this is an interesting hotel in a great location with lots of restaurnts, shops, and attractions within an easy walk.  although we didn't have our dog with us, we were pleased to see it was pet-friendly, including having pet sitters available."
"first class establishment. nice bed, towels, robes. friendly, helpful staff."
"have stayed here before and chose to return. the wine hour is always well attended.i went to the pool. while it is beautiful--it is way dark up there. more lights would be helpfulmy shower/tub faucet was a little cantankerous, but engineering showed up immediately to fix it."
very enjoyable stay. quiet room and reasonable parking.
"i was impressed with the staff at this hotel, very pleasant and helpful, very personable. my room was quiet, spacious, had a nice veiw, the decor was out of the ordinary for hotels which was nice and the tv was a large widescreen hd set. but perhaps the best part about this hotel is the surronding area of old town alexandria, va.  a very neat and interesting place, the locals were very friendly, the shops were cool, it was clean and had very easy access to the subway."
"from its eclectic d��cor to its impeccable service, the monaco offers a fantastic getaway in the heart of old town alexandria. i stayed for a birthday weekend & had a wonderful time. the bedding was incredibly comfortable, the amenities were well appointed, & the service was excellent. i highly recommend the monaco."
"if you are looking to stay at a location other than washington, d.c., alexandria and this hotel are an excellent option."
i loved this hotel. the room was cozy and comfortable. i also like that the kimpton company is concerned with the greater good of the world and a conscientous business partner based on its list of giving and affiliatiations located in the room guest book. a great place to stay!
beautiful hotel room. very comfortable beds. close to everything.
"everything was great about our stay, however, the parking situation wasn't the best due to the fact that we had to pay for parking. there was a charge for both self park and valet. don't get me wrong, the valet service and staff were top notch, but the fact that we had a vehicle, there is a charge to park either way. limited parking is always understandable, but the fee was unexpected. great service and great stay, but if you have a vehicle you will have to pay for parking."
very nice hotel with a european character. i was pleasantly surprised that the wallet parking was half price because we came in a hybrid car.lots of nice places nearby to eat. not to far metro to get into washington dc. there is a free shuttle that runs up and down king st in case you don't want to walk.
"i thought the hotel was beautiful. it is a very nice place to stay for younger people or people who do not have children. i say this because the surrounding area is really just filled with shops, bars and restaurants. there are no real attractions or things for children to do. having children there was okay as the hotel does provide a children's time. if a person goes to dc to visit the mall and the museums, i would suggest they stay closer to those attractions. other than that, the area is beautiful and the restaurants were nice and the hotel was great. my only complaint of the hotel was there was a faint scent of urine at the door."
"this place is a first class act! all of the staff are friendly and courteous, particularly kayla at the front desk lobby who is ready and willing to eagerly assist you with any questions you may have! great downtown location in historic area, large comfortable rooms, bedding, and bathroom! a magnificent mini-bar in your room which is nearly a mini market! and additionally an equally wonderful reastaurant, with an equally wonderful and attentive staff! joined the rewards stay program, and definitely intend to stay again! highly recommend!!"
"they run a good show, and the staff are outstanding.  the only complaints i have are that the bar and restaurant are ridiculously overpriced ($8 for single shot of liquor) and the rooms are decorated in a art deco sort of bizarro fashion.  leopard robe in the closet, stetch chair from the 20's in the room, star-shaped mirrors.  just weird.  but the hotel itself is first class and i highly recommend it."
the door was paper thin and i could hear the ice machine and everything being said in the hallway. it was not relaxing. the location is perfect for walking around.
everything was wonderful from the frontdesk and valets to the beautiful rooms and lobby. the only problem we had was our room had a a/c problem two nights in a row. so the second night they moved us to a larger room down the hall for the last two nights of our stay! if you decide to go just remember there is a overnight parking fee for each night your car is parked on their property.
"the service was excellent.  the free wine hour in the afternoon was lovely.  the hotel staff well trained and efficient.  i was there for a family wedding and many of the guests stayed here.it is within walking distance of dozens of ethnic restaurants,shops and the famous torpedo factory( where the weddiing was held).the room was large and had windows that opened. the bathroom was large as well and immaculate.it was a delightful experience."
"we stayed here over the thanksgiving holidays while visiting family. really enjoyed the amenities surrounding this location (restaurants nearby, cvs across the street). there was an underground parking garage, which was helpful. all rooms are well maintained. the gym was a little small (only 2 treadmills). the free coffee in the mornings and wine in the evening was great!"
fun place. bustling area.  free shuttle to airport.
"great hotel within walking distance of excellent restaurants, shops, and nationals ball park (about 12 city blocks to metro, but with all the good food there, it was a necessity to walk!). could not ask for anything more!"
"long story short: this place needs time to settle and find it's new identity. staff are either unhappy with the change from kimpton to marriott or just not well-trained. service no longer as pleasant, some staff lacking common sense/professionalism, and food no longer worth it. also missing amenities that made the hotel much more enjoyable. don't think i'll be coming back anytime soon."
"the staff here was exceptionally friendly from the moment i arrived.  the room decor was so cute, funky and modern--i absolutely loved it.  the room was very spacious and so was the bathroom.  the bed was so huge and comfortable and i loved the swiveling flat screen tv so i could watch it while in bed or swivel it to watch while on the computer at the desk.  the only negative thing i could possibly say is that the air conditioner was leaking a bit so the floor was wet around it, but it still worked perfectly so that minor flaw didn't matter to me."
"we stayed at this hotel because of the small town, old fashioned atmosphere.  it was a very slow paced town with lots of fun things to see and do.  we were in town to see the sights of washington dc but found just as many fun things to do in alexandria.  the hotel staff was very helpful and prompt with any request that we had, from leaving us more towels to getting our car from parking. i would recommend this hotel highly to anyone who is looking for a very nice place to stay in the dc area."
"i have two observations: we arrived late, 11:30 pm and immediately ordered room servece. the food finally arrived at about 1am. during the wait i called several times and ended up having words with the people at the front desk. i used the mini bar every day and kept a running tally of everything we drank. at check out time there was a big discrepancy but i was able to settle it with the front desk. all thinghs considered,we would definitely go back"
great location on king street - easy walk to the river (even with a 3 and 5 year old). staff went out of their way to engage the kids - the pool with lifeguard was a nice touch. will be back!!
"very nice room. 1/2 price parking for hybrids. only downsides: no blu-ray or dvd players in the room, front desk had no more available by 8 pm. tv was on the low end on processing power for hd channels. pretty slim selection of channels and movies on offer. otherwise a comfortable and beautiful room."
"location, quality of the hotel, and value for the cost"
"the usual quirky kimpton decor, comfort and amenities in a great location. but we had the worst service we've had in a long time in the restaurant. ultra-long waits to order and between courses, and a hostess who apologized for the server but did nothing to help speed things up."
"hotel monaco boasts a great location in the heart of old town alexandria, close to a wealth of shops and restaurants. beautifully done - a very memorable hotel experience!"
great hotel. old refurbished and remodeled. nicely done. only gripe is the ac units are inside the room and extremely noisy..
"right in the heart of old town.but, no hot water on one day of my stay."
"after reading some reviews of the hotel, i expected a traditional 'old world style' matching the area of king street.the room was very clean, with updated amenities and a staff that was very accommodating and pleasant.  i would certainly recommend the hotel even for a longer stay. transportation and the variety of dining choices were all in close proximity, easy access for any traveler."
"very comfortable kingsize bed in a clean, stylish room - recently renovated. hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. received good information from the concierge. valet parking. situated in close proximity to the waterfront, shopping, good restuarants, free local tram car which takes you to the metro. provided free transportation to ronald reagan airport on our departure. the restaurant, though not inexpensive, was very good. didn't use the exercise facility or the pool."
we traveled to alexandria for a weekend getaway and had a wonderful time at this hotel. located on duke street so your right in the heart of old town. this hotel is very well maintained and the staff is wonderful. the daily wine reception is a great way to relax and meet your fellow travelers.
"attentive staff, excellent food and services.  lobby area is very inviting, great to sit in and watch the comings and goings"
stayed in the hotel to be close for the george washington parkway ten mile classic. great location and room.
staff was very friendly and helpful without seeming fake.
"i am from old town, and i stayed in this hotel with my mom on her visit.  it had been under renovations for over a year or so, and i was really excited to see what they had done.  it was a beautiful room, view, location.  the decorating is eclectic in a very modern way, but there is still an ""old world"" kind of feel.  the amenities were great (the shower was fantastic, love the hardware!), and the concierge helped us with everything.  it is the only hotel in old town with a doorman.  i would never have guessed, but there is a pool on the third floor.  the restaurant downstairs (jackson 20) is very hip and swanky to go for a drink, and dinner there is very good as well.  i can't wait to go there when it warms up to take advantage of the courtyard and balconies."
loved it. totally divine. great decor. everything i needed and more. just charging to print in the business centre seemed a liitle tight.
everything was great until we discovered ants in out room. the hotel handled it in a professional manor anne we were promptly moved to another room.
"the hotel itself is lovely. however, room service for food the first morning took 2 hours to arrive. the first day, no one came to clean until 6pm. a try of food from that 2 hour wait sat in the hall for 28 hours- along with other trays. twice- service personal quietly locked on the door and then walked in before i could even ask who was there. on the third day, the room was cleaned but they did not actually close the door so my room and valuables were left exposed and vulnerable to theft- which is concerning when you realize that you can walk off the street into the underground garage and go into the elevator with no key and no one seeing you and straight to the hotel room floors. there are other small things but these were the big issues. i stay in hotels a lot- this is the first time i felt it really important to write a negative review."
"this was the best hotel we ever stayed in. the staff was very attentive to your ever need. within the hour after arriving the doorman ""eddie"" will remember our name and always anticipated your request. they are very familiar with all of the entertainment and places to eat in the area. iwe actually did not want to checkout.   the room is like being in heaven."
nice ambiance and very comfortable beds. the staff was pleasant in person and over the phone. there was coffee in the morning at the lobby and wine in the afternoons/evenings ... all on the house.
"loved the location! close to cute shops and restaurants. the room was great, and especially loved the animal print robes!"
i was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and facilities of the hotel. it definitely earns the 4.5+ rating. great location and walking distance to restaurants.
"very pleasant stay, gorgeous rooms and great staff"
"very classy, comfortable hotel with beautiful decor."
"my husband and i spent our anniversary weekend at this hotel, as we do every year. however, this time around was not our usual pleasant experience. we had a unfortunate luck of being placed next door to a rude family with unruly children. the parents decided to take advantage of the wine reception, while leaving their two young children under the age of 10 alone to scream, bang on walls, slam doors and run up and down the hallways for hours. at one point one of the children rode the elevator down with my husband (a complete stranger) to find their mother. i will say the hotel staff did a great job locating their parents and handling the situation. later in the evening, my husband was confronted by an intoxicated women wanting to join him in our hotel room. needless to say, the wine reception was a spoil to our weekend. great hotel and staff otherwise. don't know that we will be returning again though!"
"great location within walking distance of the party we were attending. can be pricey depending on what is going on in the area. also, there is an additional charge for wifi and parking. the best thing was the wine happy hour and the free sunday nyt."
very comfy bed...extremely convieniant in olde town. not far from airport
"it was great. i enjoyed the farmers markets and the variety of stores and restaurants in the area. the room was big but the tv had static all day and we were unable to utilize it. unfortunately, i was not able to be accommodated for an extended stay."
the hotel was terrific. i had been in alexanderia may times but it was great to be staying in such a nice hotel right in the middle of old town.
needs more lighting in bathroom- ac needs upgrade- power outage of entire hotel for 12 hours -hotel had excellent service even during power outage-very professional rooms new well decorated staff attentive and very courteous
"i was surprised to learn that there was a separate charge for parking, but i probably didn't read the description fully.  it was valet parking only.  the room air conditioner was wonderfully cold, but quite noisy.  however, it was sort of white noise because we didn't hear the street sounds.  requested additional bath towels; no problem."
"i miss the kimpton, no more wine, minibar, or breakfast. my hotel room took three different trips to the front counter to get a working key. during my last stay i had a individual walk in my room at 0200 in the morning, hotel told the police that sometimes the doors do not close and lock properly, please check your doors. this use to be my go to hotel when i stay in dc, i am now staying elsewhere."
"i booked the room for myself and a friend for her birthday celebration. the room was very comfortable for the few hours in which we were present. the front desk staff and valet's were very friendly and helpful. one tip...the adjacent restaurant (jackson 20) was introduced to us as a place to get brunch the next day. we were looking forward to that, however when we approached the hostess for a table we were told that all tables were saved for those with reservations. it would have been nice to have been told that reservations were needed during our check-in process. even better, front desk staff should offer to make those reservations for hotel guests."
"i brought my sister and kids from orlando to alexandria and wanted them to have a lovely, comfortable and elegant experience.  so, i purposely chose hotel monaco given the wonderful d��cor, reminiscent of 1930s or 40s ""old hollywood"", classic elegance, amenities, shopping and restaurants on king street, high ratings, and affordable price.  the front desk staff was amazing, very gracious and personable.  when we needed extra bedding for the room, the staff responded right away.  everyone was wonderfully gracious and kind.  we enjoyed shopping and dining on king street, and we also took the king street trolley to the metro station for sightseeing in dc!  we enjoyed visiting the smithsonian museums, the national mall, the white house and lincoln memorial. my family was thrilled and said this was the most beautiful hotel they had every stayed in!"
service was very good. the tub was not draining but they did fix it for us after offering another room. the pet goldfish they brought for the kids was a nice touch and the wine hour for mom and dad was great!
"trip to old town, alexandria, va included business and pleasure. the hotel monaco is perfectly situated in alexandria-access to restaurants, trolley, historical houses. in addition, the staff of the hotel is friendly and so willing to be helpful. bicycles are available to borrow and the pool is nice. rooms are very comfortable. highly recommend for anyone visiting va and dc."
the hotel used to serve wine. no longer. no more words to write about
"hotel staff was very friendly. location is perfect - close to everything. two negatives - the hotel shuttle failed to show up. the front desk assured me this was an unusual occurrence and offered to pay my cab fare. this was a bad start to an otherwise great visit. the other negative - no coffee maker in the room. this is tough for a person who can't start up without caffeine. coffee is served in the lobby at around 6:15am for those who want to ""sleep in""."
excellent value for quality accommodations in charming setting.
this is a great hotel for a honeymoon. my wife and i stayed their for 1 night. the hotel staff and service is absolutely wonderful but if you want to sleep in that is not going to happen. housekeeping woke us up not once but twice. once at 8am and next at 10am. checkout is at 12pm but since they were so concerned we decided to checkout by 10:30am. to make matters even worse the vallet brought my car up front but wasn't there to give me the key as i stood out in the cold for 10 minutes. not a good experience.p.s. don't count on room service to be having a great meal as the menu suggests.
"my stay was good not excellent due to the temperature of the room. those days that i stay the ambient temperature was 18 degree my room remain 68 to 70. my room was cold. the technician came did something and said i'll call back in 30 minutes, he never call nor never return, the room remain cold. this is a 4 star hotel i should not be going thru this inconvenience for an expensive room, i had to reduce my stay. bad experience."
"this hotel is not worthy of the limp tom name. the staff was very nice but it stops there. i booked this hotel because it has a 4.5 rating and is a vip + hotel on expedia. it's a 3 star hotel at best and never once did i get a vip treatment. to the contrary i think that since i booked through expedia they have me the worst possible room in the entire hotel. room was like a marriott room which is fine but nothing special. it was next to the maintenance entrance so there was loud noise constantly. it was not prepared for my arrival and there was some kind of leak so an entire section of carpet was soaking wet. i would not recommend this hotel to anybody. i am also beginning to think that booking hotels through expedia is a bad idea because i always get treated worse if i do. i'm a gold member w expedia and i always get shafted when i book with them. this is the third time in a row i've had to complain to expedia about their ""partner"" hotels."
"i have stayed at six kimpton hotels and i have come to expect an outstanding level of service above and beyond a typical hotel. the hotel monaco did not live up to the level of service i expected. when the shuttle dropped me off at the curbside of the hotel, no one helped with the luggage or even held the door open; this was 2pm in the afternoon. the desk clerks were short and not forthcoming with information about the area. when you are in town for only 24 hours, my time in town is precious and i would expect them to volunteer helpful information for a tourist. then when we took the shuttle back to the airport and the driver had the music on loud while another passenger and myself were trying to have a conversation and he drove like a maniac. very disappointed."
"i would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to the dc area. not only was the staff friendly, the hotel lovely, and the room comfortable, it was located walking distance to amazing dining and shopping."
staff couldn't be more helpful or friendlier. wine reception is very nice.
"marble bathrooms, coffee and tea, great restaurant, quiet...i could not love this hotel more.  and it is three short blocks to the river where there is an awesome walking/running path.  tons of restaurants and shops right outside the door and a drug store.  seriously it is awesome!"
the hotel should've been better prepared for the icy conditions outside. it took them a while to get icemelt down.  extremely unsafe for patrons to walk outside the hotel
"we truly enjoyed out stay. the staff was very helpful and the location was perfect for catching a show at the birchmere, shopping, a mini spa day and waterfront sight seeing."
lobby staff were very helpful.  room service needed to be contacted on the 3rd day to replace towels.
"myself and 15 yo and 10 yo granddaughters came for a short 3 niter to visit washington, dc. my husband recommended staying in alexandria. the hotel was 1st rate in comfort and design. the people could not have been nicer. we were close to the metro, a free trolley and many restaurants and shopping. except for the heat and humidity outside, the trip was fantastic."
great hotel! one disappointment was we were traveling with children and the pool was broken.
very nice hotel.great location.this will be our new hotel to stay at when we are in va
"my husband and i, along with another couple, really enjoyed our stay at the alexandria monaco. we were there for a full weekend to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. the hotel staff made it very welcoming for us by providing champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries. we upgraded our room to one with a terrace, which was nice because it was a large room, and we got to see another wedding in the courtyard. the front door of the hotel is right on king street, which was always busy with people walking around. the hotel is within walking distance of so many things. there are several cafes and small restaurants nearby. parking is reasonable compared to other parking garages in and around the dc area. we would definitely go back to this kimpton property."
loved this hotel. such a treat and felt totally spoiled.
"the hotel monaco was a great experience. i cannot say the same for hotels.com. when i landed at the airport and contacted the hotel, they did not have my reservation, even though i had a reservation through your service. it was clear to me there was a communication breakdown at hotels.com and i should have been notified of any issues in advance. i will likely not be using hotels.com again."
fantastic. very pet friendly and an awesome happy hour
fun hotel atmosphere and in a fantastic location for shopping and great restaurants!
"it was centrally located and very dog friendly. we enjoyed our time. although we had some issues with our room, they were fixed quickly."
"in a pinch after a cancelled flight. was able to find this hotel. i had never been to alexandria, but old town is a beautiful, great neighborhood. lots of restaurant choices. the staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. a great stay overall."
as always it was wonderful. my family and i are repeat visitors. we travel to alexandria every year and prefer the monaco above any other hotel.
"can't say enough nice things about this hotel - the staff is helpful and friendly, the location can't be beat, and it's just an appealing, quirky (in a good way), comfortable place. we're big fans of the pool and the daily wine reception in the (really attractive & cozy) lobby. even the price is competitive for the great location (literally a short walk to just about everything) and the level of service."
"this was by far one of the nicest hotels i have ever stayed at. the staff was extremely curtious and went out of their way to help me in whatever i desired. the location is in old towne alexandria by many shops and wonderful restaurants. the room was cozy, exquisite and spectacularly clean. i would recommend this hotel to anyone on business or just traveling for leisure as it is what a hotel stay should be."
great hotel with great service and near so many cool places.
"the area of old town is awesome and very romantic. my girlfriend loved the area, water, restaurants, and shops. the hotel was beautiful . room was very clean and the design was top notch . definitely would come back to the hotel . front seat service was top notch , 5 star bath room and amenities"
"my roommate and i are from nyc and were coming down to dc/alexandria for a wedding and we picked this hotel because it was 2 blocks from the wedding location. i wish we had had more time to take advantage of all the hotel had to offer. it was an incredibly comfortable hotel room and the service was always friendly. my roommate needed a lint roller and she called guest services and while they didn't have a lint roller, they tried their best to solve her problem and brought her a roll of scotch tape. we had some drinks and appetizers at the hotel restaurant (jackson 20? jackson #), and the drinks were fun and delicious, as was the cheese and meat plate (i can't spell the fancy word for meat plate--charcuterie?). while it didn't wake me up or keep me up, once i was awake, i did notice that the sound from the hallway was very easy to hear through the door as we were right across from the elevator, but it was not an inconvenience to me, and the rest of our stay was very quiet and private."
"we very much appreciated the welcome note and complimentary wine and treats in honor of our anniversary. the hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful. and the hotel is very conveniently located. but if we'd known that this place was going to be overrun with dogs, we'd have booked in somewhere else, like the sister property lorien (where we've enjoyed staying before). you really should highlight to potential guests that dogs and cats are allowed at this property, so those of us who have allergies or just don't enjoy having animals up close and personal can have advance notice of the situation here. at least give patrons the option of booking a pet-free room!"
great hotel / outstanding location. only suggestions would be (1) have stayed there many times - coffee in lobby should be hotter (2) could use a second chair in room beside desk chair (3) parking costs are exorbitant
"restful, great location, multiple dinning and shopping options surrounding hotel. lobby coffee in the morning and hot chocolate in the evening were nice touches."
"we have stayed here before and we have always loved this place. they do a lot of complimentary little events like wine tastings in the evenings, and free coffee and hot chocolate in the mornings.this was our first time visiting with our dog and they were great! we will make this our annual place to go right before the holidays! a fantastic way to explore old town all within walking distance."
"this hotel was the best!!!  it was in the center of old town and we were able to walk around town and to the metro with no problems at all.  with its great location there isn't anywhere you can't go in just a few minutes, including shopping and restaurants.  the hotel was just renovated and it is beautiful.  the staff was very helpful and attentive.  the housekeeping staff was very polite and apologized if the towel cart was even a little bit in the way.  we will definitely stay here again."
"this is a delightful hotel -- classy and comfortable.  two things stand out:  the room was wonderful with lots of space, a comfy bed, a chaise lounge, great desk area, lots of lighting, and nice bathroom (room's only negative:  noisy air conditioner), and the hotel staff were exceptionally welcoming and helpful.  while the other alexandria hotels are 15 blocks away (near the metro station), this hotel is right in the middle of the historic district, close to great restaurants and shops, the torpedo art center, and the riverfront.  we used the free trolley to ride to the metro (short taxi ride in the am before the trolley begins service at 11:30 am) and the hotel's free shuttle to return to reagan national airport.  this hotel convinved me:  i will ldefinitely ook for kimpton hotels in the future!"
"great location, nice amenities, amazing service!  when we checked in we were greated by [...] at the desk.  he asked what brought us to the monaco.  we were there for our 29th wedding anniversary.  we checked into the room, then went for a walk in old town.  upon our return we were pleasantly surprised to find a bucket of beer on ice, a large bowl of chips with salsa and a nice card from [...] wishing us a happy anniversary!!  he also gave us 2 gift cards for free wine in their restaurant.  the valet staff were helpful and pleasant.  they suggested an umbrella due to impending rain (an umbrella was in our room).  it did indeed rain. if there was a negative... it was being charged parking while staying there.  overall, very enjoyable and would definitely recommend.  (btw -- if you have dogs, they cater to them - big time.)"
"we love alexandria, and the monaco hotel fits all our needs."
"it was a quick trip to visit relatives, so we did not use all of the services. the staff was friendly and helpful. having parking, including valet parking available in alexandria was a real plus. it is convenient to other transportation if we had wanted to see the sights. we were disappointed in the restaurant at dinner, though we had been told it was reasonably priced for the area and had good food."
the hotel was very clean and the staff was professional and courteous. old town alexandrea was beautiful and having a room right there that is walking distance to everything made it better. i most definitely would stay here again. the only down side is parking is way over priced. everything else was awesome.
"we have stayed at this hotel a few times on the past. our most recent stay was somewhat disappointing. quality of the sheets, towels, toilet paper used to be much better. however, the price was good for the location"
i was grateful to get a hotel in the area after the windstorm had knocked out power. my 97 yr old companion had to have ac in the 90+ degree days. having a restaurant connected was a priority when making the reservation. the handicap room didn't have grab bars in the bathroom or walk in shower. the door was large enough to accommodate a wheelchair. no in room coffee. the staff was very nice.
the only thing weird about our stay is that it was extremely creepy at times because of the old feel. the heater made this weird sneeze sound.
